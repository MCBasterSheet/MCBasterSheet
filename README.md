# Hello MCB 150 Students
  - This is a mastersheet of all the content you need for the 2024 Spring Semester; however, it may even be able to be used later down the line
    - While it does have many things from the textbooks to the lectures, it does not have everything
    - Continue to go to class, continue to go to discussions, and make sure that you still study for each exam
  - Aside from that, I wish you best of lucks in MCB 150!

P.S. This Mastersheet, due to the fact that it was not pre-planned, has some outdated areas that will need to be reformatted. Otherwise, this should work for a majority of your use cases
