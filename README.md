# HEY START HERE!
This is a mastersheet of all the content you need for the 2024 Spring Semester for MCB150; however, it may even be able to be used later down the line for 2024 Fall, 2025 Spring, etc.

## Notes:
- Chapters 1-4 (up to 4.4) has missing diagrams, ugly low quality photos, and while it has everything you want to know, it is just an eye sore. 
- Please continue to go to class, continue to go to discussions, and make sure that you still study for each exam. This is not a get out of jail free
- Aside from that, I wish you best of ??? in MCB 150!
