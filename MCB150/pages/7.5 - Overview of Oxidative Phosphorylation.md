> During the first three stages of glucose metabolism, oxidizing glucose makes 6 CO2, 4 ATP, 10 NADH, 2 FADH2
> How are these electrons from NADH and FADH2 removed to get more ATP?
> We see it here in oxidative phosphorylation
> FADH2 and NADH are oxidized, and ATP is made by the phosphoryllation of ADP

# The Electron Transport Chain Establishes an Electrochemical Gradient
- ETC consists of small protein complexes, small organic molescules in the inner mitrochondrial membrane
- It is a chain as the components pass the electrons from one component to the next in a series of redox reactions
- Most members are protein complexes (I-IV) having **prostetic groups**, small molecules permanently attached to the surface of proteins to aid their function
  - E.g. cytochrome oxidase has 2 prostetic groups with an iron atom
  - The iron can readily accept/donate an electron
- Ubiquinone is not a protein and is a small organic molecule accepting or releasing an electron

- The red line shows path of electron flow
  - Electrons from NADH or FADH2 are transferred to components of the ETC
  - The electron path is a series of redox reactions where electrons are moves to components with increasingly higher electronegativities
  - The end has oxygen as it is the most electronegative
  - ETC is also the respiratory chain as we use the oxygen we breathe
  - Other organisms can use other molecules instead of oxygen
    
- NADH and FADH2 donates electrons at different points in the ETC
  - 2 electrons from NADH are first transferred one at a time to NADH dehydrogenase (complex 1)
  - Then to Ubiquinone, to cytochrome b-c1 (complex III), cytochrome c, and cytochrome oxidase (complex IV)
  - The final electron acceptor is O2
  - For **FADH2** it just sends the electrons to succinate reductase (complex II) then to ubiquinone, then to the rest of the chain)
 
- Some energy released in electron movement is used to pump H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space
  - This establishes a large H+ electrochemical gradient where concentrations of H+ is higher outside than inside the mitochondrial matrix

- Chemicals Inhibiting this flow has lethal affects
  - Cytochrome oxidase (IV) is inhibited by cyanide, preventing enough ATP to be made for survival
 
# ATP Synthase Makes ATP via Chemiosmosis
- The second event of oxidative Phosphorylation is synthesizing ATP via **ATP Synthase**
- The H+ electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is a source of potential energy
- When the H+ flows back into the matrix, it is done through the ATP synthase
- Then ATP synthase uses the free enrgy released from flowing H+ ions to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic Phosphate ion
  - This is an example of energy conversion: H+ gradient to chemical potential energy in ATP
  - Called Chemiosmosis (osmos meaning push)
    - Fucking brits made it
- Regulation is done via availability of ETC substrates like NADH and O2, the ATP/ADP ratio.
  - If ATP high, ATP binds to subunit of cytochrome oxidase (IV) inhibiting the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation
  - if ADP high, it is stimulated as 1. ADP stimulates cytochrome oxidase and 2. ADP is a substrate used with inorganic Phosphate to make ATP

# NADH Oxidation Makes a Large Proportion of a Cell's ATP
