> Non-coding RNAs literally fixing your heart
>
> Cartilage-hair hypoplasia exists and it is linked to a single mutant gene. This gene encodes RNA molecules not for a protein, rather this RNA makes RNase MRP, RNA-protein complex for modification of some ribosomal and mitochondrial RNAs.
>
> This took a shit load of time as we didn't have the tools for protein-coding identification
>
> Our genome got protein-coding genes, but also a lot of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which don't make polypeptides
>
>  We see how researchers find ncRNAs making spectacular arrays of functions in everyone. THey are important in DNA replication, chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and genome defense
>
> They are more abundant than mRNAs, 20% to mRNA, 80% to ncRNAs! Abnormalities here are associated with a lot of diseases, like CHH, cance,r neurological disorders, and cardiovascular disease. They help plants grow!
>
> This chapter will cover the properties of ncRNAs, then specific examples of functions they perform. The end of the chapter considers the role of ncRNAs in different human disease and in plant health.
