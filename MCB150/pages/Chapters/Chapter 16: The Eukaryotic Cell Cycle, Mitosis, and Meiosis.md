> - Our body is made of 10 trillion to 50 trillion cells (insane % error, if you ask me)
> - Started from a single egg+sperm complex, then we have this adult known as you
> - Thankfully it is highly accurate in replication, otherwise we would not be very alive
> - **Cell division**, the reproduction of cells is highly regulated! We have phases for a reason!
> - The Cells of Eukaryotic species follow one of two sorting processes letting new daughter cells receive the right number and types of chromosomes
> - We have mitosis, 2 daughter cells of identical genetic material
> - We also have meiosis, 2 sets of chromosomes produce daughter cells with one set of chromosomes
> - Lastly we see variation in structure and number of chromosomes, and certain mechanisms alter chromosome structure and number have important consequences for the organisms that carry them
