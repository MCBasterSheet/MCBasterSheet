> # Enzymes are proteins acting as critical catalysts to speed up thousands of different reactions in cells.
> Every living cell continuously performs thousands of such chemical reactions to sustain life.
> ## Metabolism is the sum total of all chemical reactions occuring in an organism
> It also refers to the specific set of chemical reactions happening at the cellular level.
> E.g. Biologists may ask of sugar metabolism or fat metabolism.
> Most types of metabolism involves breaking down or synthesizing organic molecules
>## This chapter refers to Energy and Chemical Reactions
> We will examine what factors ocntrol the direction of a chemical reaction, its rate, and we will extensively study the role of enzymes. We also see metabolism at the cellular level, and we examine how chemical reactions coordinate wiht each other in metabloic pathways. Lastly, we will also see the variety of ways metabolic pathways are regulated and how organic molecules are recycled.

P.S. Not putting in 6.2 because I rage quitted when my data got randomly lost
