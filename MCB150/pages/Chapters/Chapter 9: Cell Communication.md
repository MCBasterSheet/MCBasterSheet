> HOW?
>
> Cell Signaling
>
> Apoptosis happens because signals cause particular cells to die. Or if the cell just doesn't call back.
> Cell communication is just a process where cells detect, interpret, and respond to signals in their environment, a signal being an agent able to influence properties of cells
> This chapters sees how cells find environment signals and how they make signals to communicate with other cells
> **Signals!** And say that with less excitement, influence properties of cells
>
> This chapter sees how cells detect environment signals and how they make signals to communicate with other cells, involving receiving and sending signals but also their interpretation via receptors.
>
> Before we get into this, we start with general features of cell communication, letting us discuss ways cells receive, process, and respond to signals from other cells letting us learn about cell communication and its amazing diversity of signaling molecules and yada yada yada. We conclude by learning how cells create suicide pacts (apoptosis)
