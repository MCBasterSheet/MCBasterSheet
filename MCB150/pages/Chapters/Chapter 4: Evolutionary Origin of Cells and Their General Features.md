- Things like cancer are here along with other diseases like sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis.
- mid-1800s, Matthias Schleiden saw plants under microscope and saw many cells next to each other. 1838 he said, cells be living!
	- Friend came over Theodor Schwann saw same type of stuff under animal cells. 1839 Schwann extended it
	  Then 2 decades later Rudolf Virchow said that every cell originates from another cell.
- Cell theory is in three parts:
	- All living organisms are composed of 1+ cells
	- Cells are the smallest units of life
	- New cells come only from pre-existing cells via cell division
- Used to be unseen, but now we unravel them at a molecular level.
	- Super complex and adaptable cells man
