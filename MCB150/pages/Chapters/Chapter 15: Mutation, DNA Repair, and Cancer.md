> - Mutations are a heritable change in the genetic material, where the order of nucleotide bases in DNA molecule, its base sequence, is changed permanently, also being passable from mother to daughter cells during cell division
> - Mutations leading to cancer cause particular genes to be expressed in an abnormal way, like how a mutation could affect the transcription of a gene, the way the chromatin structure forms (uh oh, cancer!)
> - Mutations are the reason for long term continuity of life! They make the foundations of Evolutionary change! They make the variation to make some better at living in their environments!
>   - Negative: Cancer
>   - In all seriousness though, If you have an already working gene, and you suddenly have a series of nucleotides change, you're more likely to get XP and cystic fibrosis before you are able to piss lasers from your eyes
> - To avoid Cancer, all species have evolved ways to repair damaged DNA, reversing the DNA damage before a permanent mutation could occur
> - But first, we cover mutations (Oh how I love them!)
