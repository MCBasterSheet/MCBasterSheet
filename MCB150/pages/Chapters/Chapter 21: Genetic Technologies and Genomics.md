If you suffer from Hemophilia A, you just get factor VII that is produced by cells from a laboratory, an application of **recombinant DNA technology**. The early 70s got Stanford idiots to isolate DNA in a test tube and covalently link them and put it inside of a host cell that let the recombinant molecules make many identical copies. This is **gene cloning**, but first we cover recombinant DNA technology then to the cloning so we can see how geneticists are able to fuck around and find out in terms of what happens when gene sequences and phenotypic consequences.

Then after you fuck around and find out for one of the longest chapters we have had to read so far for MCB150, we cover **genomics** (IN ANOTHER ONE OF THE LONGEST CHAPTERS WE HAVE TO READ), molecular analysis of an entire genome for a species. Recent years, molecular techniques have progressed to the point where researchers can study the structure and function of many genes as large, integrated networks to to make changesto the genome to silence or alter particular areas.

Then to close this shitty ass year off, we will be covering the genome characteristics of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We see what the fuck is the deal with repetitive sequences.
