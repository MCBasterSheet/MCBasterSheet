> Cool ass protein binding to DNA to regulate genes (CAP!)
>
> Emilio is turned on by weightlifting. Sorry, I mean some weightlifitng genes in Emilio are turned on in response to weightlifting, with more proteins being synthesized for Emilio's muscles
>
> Gene expression is the process where information in a gene is made into a functional product, like RNA molecules or proteins. Most genes being regulated so proteins are only being made at appropriate times in specific amounts
>
> Gene Regulation is the ability for a cell to control their own gene expression. Some are constant in expression levels, **constitutive genes**, or housekeeping genes. They encode proteins needed for the survival of an organism
>
> A lot of genes are important for the upkeep of an organism, so this chapter will overview the benefits of gene regulation, general mechanisms of it in bacteria and eukaryotes, and how it is done in the face of environmental changes in bacteria and eukaryotes
