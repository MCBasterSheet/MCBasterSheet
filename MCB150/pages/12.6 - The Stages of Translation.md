> # Learning Goals
> 1. Describe the three stages of Translation
> 2. Summarize the similarities and differences between translation in bacteria and in eukaryotes
> 3. Explain how some antibiotics inhibit the growth of bacteria by interfering with translation
>
> - Like transcription, the process of translation occurs in three stages
> 1. Initiation
> 2. Elongation
> 3. Termination
>
> - The image below provides the overview
> - Initiation, an mRNA, the first tRNA, and the ribosomal subunits assemble into a complex
> - In elongation, the ribosome moves in the 5` to 3 prime direction from the start codon in the mRNA towards the stop codon to make the polypeptide
> - Termination, the ribosome reaches the stop codon and the complex disassembles, releasing the completed polypeptide
>
> Now we observe how each step occurs

# Translation is Initiated with the Assembly of mRNA, tRNA, and the Ribosomal Sub units
- During **initiation**
