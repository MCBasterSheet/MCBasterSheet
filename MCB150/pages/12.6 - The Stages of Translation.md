# Translation is Initiated with the Assembly of mRNA, tRNA, and the Ribosomal Sub units
- During **initiation** a complex is formed between the mRNA molecule, the first tRNA, and the ribosomal subunits
- All species has the complex requiring the help of proteins called initiation factors that facilitate the interactions between these components
- To assemble these requires an input of energy from Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), being hydrolyzed by certain initiation factors to provide the energy needed
  - **When not involved in translation, the small and large ribosomal subunits exist separately**
- Here are the steps for assembly:
   1. To begin assembly of the complex, an mRNA binds to the small ribosomal subunit (image below), where the binding of mRNA to this subunit is facilitated by a **short ribosomal-binding site**—a stretch of nucleotides whose bases are complementary to those in a portion of the 16S rRNA in the small ribosomal subunits—near the 5` end of the mRNA. In the end, the mRNA becomes bound to the ribosome because the ribosomal-binding site and rRNA H-Bond to each other via base pairing, where the start codon is usualyl just a few nucleotides downstream (3 prime end) from the ribosomal-binding site.
    2. A specific tRNA, functioning as the initiator tRNA, recognizes the start codon (AUG) and binds to it; however, in eukaryotes, the tRNA carries methionine while bacteria carry methionine modified by attaching a formyl group
    3. Completing initiation happens when the large ribosomal subunit associates with the small subunit. At the end, the initiator tRNA is located at the P site of the ribosome.

- Eukaryotes have the initiation phase differ from the translation phase in two ways compared to bacteria
  - Rather than an RNA sequence functioning as a ribosomal-binding site, eukaryotic mRNAs have a 7-methylguanosine cap (5` cap) at their 5 prime end
    - This 5` cap is recognized by cap-binding proteins that promote binding mRNA to the small ribosomal subunit
  - In bacterial, the start codon is close to the ribosomal-binding site, but the location of a start codon in eukaryotes are much more variable.
- In 1978, Marilyn Kozak proposed that small ribosomal subunits identifies a start codon by beginning at the 5` end of a sequence and the scanning along mRNA in the 3 prime direction to search for an AUG sequence
  - Analyzing the sequences of a lot of eukaryotic mRNA let Kozak and co. find that the sequence around an AUG codon lets is be recognized as a start codon.

  - Aside from the AUG codon, a guanine just past the start codon and sequence of 6 bases directly upstream from the start codon are important for start codon selection
    - If the first AUG codon is within a site that deviates merkedly from this optimal sequence, the small subunit can **just skip this codon and use another AUG codon further down**
    - Once the small subunit finds a start codon, an initiator tRNA binds to the start codon, and then the large ribosomal subunit associates with the small subunit to complete the assembly process.
