>Membranes are composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most membrane components of eukaryotes are made at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This section covers how phospholipids are made at the ER membrane and the process how transmembrane proteins are inserted into the ER membrane and how carbohydrates are attached to some proteins.

# Lipid Synthesis Occurs at the ER Membrane
  - In Eukaryotes, the cytosol and endomembrane system work in unison to synthesize most lipids.
    - This occurs at the cytosolic leaflet of the smooth ER membrane
    - Below shows a simplified pathway for the synthesis of phospholipids
    - Main componenets being two fatty acids, one glycerol molecule, one phosphate, and a polar head group
      - The main building blocks are enzymes in the cytosol, or taken into cells from food

- To begin the process of phospholipid synthesis, the fatty acids are activated by attaching to an organic molecule called Coenzyme A
- Activation promotes bonding of the two fatty acids to a glycerol-phosphate molecule
- The resulting molecule is then inserted into the cytosolic leaflet of the ER membrane
- The phosphate is removed from Glycerol, and then a pola rmolecule already linked to phosphate is attached to glycerol
  - The example shows the polar head group as choline, but many other head groups are possible
- Phospholipids are initially inserted into the cytosolic leaflet
- Flippases in the ER membrane transfer ~half of newly made phospholipids to the other leaflet so similar amounts of lipids are found in both lipids

> ### Concept Check: How are phospholipids transferred to the leaflet of the ER membrane that faces the ER lumen?
> Phospholipids are transferred to the other leaflet of the ER membrane via enzymes called flippases

- The lipids made in the ER membrane are then transferred to other membranes by a lot of method
  - It can diffuse laterally to the nuclear envelope
  - Lipids could also be transported via vesicles to the Golgi, lysosomes, vacuoles, or plasma membrane
  - Another mod of lipid transfer involve lipid exchange proteins, extracting a lipid from membrane, diffusing it through a cell, then inserting it into another membrane
    - This transfer could occur between any two membranes, even between the endomembrane system and semiautonomous organelles
    - E.g. Lipid exchange proteins can exchange lipids between the ER and mitochondria, where chloroplasts and mitochondria can synthesize certain types of lipids which are transferred from these organelles to toher cellular membranes via lipid exchange proteins

## Most Transmembrane Proteins Are First Inserted into the ER Membrane
