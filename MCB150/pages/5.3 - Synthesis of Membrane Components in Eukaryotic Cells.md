>Membranes are composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most membrane components of eukaryotes are made at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This section covers how phospholipids are made at the ER membrane and the process how transmembrane proteins are inserted into the ER membrane and how carbohydrates are attached to some proteins.
