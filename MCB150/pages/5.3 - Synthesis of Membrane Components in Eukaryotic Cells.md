>Membranes are composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most membrane components of eukaryotes are made at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This section covers how phospholipids are made at the ER membrane and the process how transmembrane proteins are inserted into the ER membrane and how carbohydrates are attached to some proteins.

# Lipid Synthesis Occurs at the ER Membrane
  - In Eukaryotes, the cytosol and endomembrane system work in unison to synthesize most lipids.
    - This occurs at the cytosolic leaflet of the smooth ER membrane
    - Below shows a simplified pathway for the synthesis of phospholipids
    - Main componenets being two fatty acids, one glycerol molecule, one phosphate, and a polar head group
      - The main building blocks are enzymes in the cytosol, or taken into cells from food

- To begin the process of phospholipid synthesis, the fatty acids are activated by attaching to an organic molecule called Coenzyme A
- Activation promotes bonding of the two fatty acids to a glycerol-phosphate molecule
- The resulting molecule is then inserted into the cytosolic leaflet of the ER membrane
- The phosphate is removed from Glycerol, and then a pola rmolecule already linked to phosphate is attached to glycerol
  - The example shows the polar head group as choline, but many other head groups are possible
- Phospholipids are initially inserted into the cytosolic leaflet
- Flippases in the ER membrane transfer ~half of newly made phospholipids to the other leaflet so similar amounts of lipids are found in both lipids

> ### Concept Check: How are phospholipids transferred to the leaflet of the ER membrane that faces the ER lumen?
> Phospholipids are transferred to the other leaflet of the ER membrane via enzymes called flippases

- The lipids made in the ER membrane are then transferred to other membranes by a lot of method
  - It can diffuse laterally to the nuclear envelope
  - Lipids could also be transported via vesicles to the Golgi, lysosomes, vacuoles, or plasma membrane
  - Another mod of lipid transfer involve lipid exchange proteins, extracting a lipid from membrane, diffusing it through a cell, then inserting it into another membrane
    - This transfer could occur between any two membranes, even between the endomembrane system and semiautonomous organelles
    - E.g. Lipid exchange proteins can exchange lipids between the ER and mitochondria, where chloroplasts and mitochondria can synthesize certain types of lipids which are transferred from these organelles to toher cellular membranes via lipid exchange proteins

## Most Transmembrane Proteins Are First Inserted into the ER Membrane
  - Excluding proteins destined for semiautonomous organelles, most transmembrane proteins contain an ER signal sequence directing them to the ER membrane
    - If a polypeptide also contains a stretch of 20 amino acids that are mostly hydrophobic and form an alpha-helix, this region will become a transmemebrane segment
  - In the example shown below, a polypeptide contains such a sequence
    - After the ER signal squence is removed by signal peptidase, a membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment is made
    - Other polypeptides may contain more than one transmembrane segments
    - Every time a polypeptide sequence containing 20+ hydrophobic amino acids and forms an Alpha-Helix, additional transmembrane segments are synthesized into the membrane
  - From the ER, membrane proteins can be transported via vesicles to Golgi, lysosomes, vacuoles, or plasma membranes

> ### Concept Check: What Structural Feature of a Polypeptide causes a region of it to form a transmemebrane segment?
> Features casuing a transmembrane segment  is a 20+ amino acid segment of mostly non-polar side chains

# The Attachment of Carbohydrates to Proteins Occurs in the ER and Golgi Apparatus
  - **Glycosylation** refers to the process of attaching a carbohydrate to a lipid or protein
  - Carbohydrate + Lipid = Glycolipid
  - Carbohydrate to a protein is a glycoprotein
  - But why Glycosylize?
    - Roles of carbohydrates in cell structure and function is not fully undrestood
    - Some functional consequences have been detected
    - Glycolipids and glycoproteins play a role in cell surface recognition
      - If these two are found in the plasma membrane, the carbohydrate portion is found in the extracellular region
      - This is important in embryonic development as lots of cell movement occur, sliding over each other to make body structures.
      - This migration requires recognition of cell types via carbohydrates on cell surfaces
    - Carbohydrates on the plasma membrane can shield cell from mechanical and physical damages and shield on glycosylated proteins, protect them from harsh environmental conditions and extracellular proteases (enzymes digesting proteins)
  - Two forms of protein glycosylation occurs in eukaryotes: N-linked and O-linked
    - N-linked, in archaea, attaches carbohydrates to the amino acid asparagine in a polypeptide
      - It is an N-link as the carbohydrate is attached to a **nitrogen of the aparagine side chain**
        - Needs a group of 14 sugar molecules (**carbohydrate tree**) to be built onto a lipid in the ER membrane
        - oligosaccharide transferase then transfers the carbohydrate tree from lipid to an asparagine in the polypeptide
      - They commonly occur on the membrane proteins transported to the cell surface
        
  - Image of the N-linked glycosylation in archaea:

  - O-linked glycosylation only occurs in the Golgi apparatus
    - It involves adding string of sugars to the oxygen atom of a **serine or threonine side chain** in a polypeptide
    - In animals, O-linked glycosylation are required to produce proteoglycans
      - These are highly glycosylated proteins secreted from cells to help organize the Extracellular matrix around cells.
      - They are a component of mucus and the high concentrations of carbohydrates give mucus its slimy texture
