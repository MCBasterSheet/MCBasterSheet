> # Learning Goals
> 1. Describe the Structure of Nucleosomes and the 30-nm fiber, and explain how the 30-nm fiber forms loop domains
> 2. Outline the various levels of compaction that lead to a metaphase chromosome
>
> - Typical eukaryotic Chromosomes contain single, linear, double-stranded DNA molecules that could be 10^8 base pairs in length
> - Chromosomes means a discrete unit of genetic material
  > - Human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes
> - Chromatin is the complex of DNA and Proteins that make up Eukaryotic Chromosomes
> - Chromosomes are dynamic structures alternating in tight and loose states
> - Here, we will see how chromosomes are compacted into the cell's nucleus and how the additional compaction is necessary to produce highly condensed chromosomes during cell division
