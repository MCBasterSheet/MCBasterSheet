### The Two Primary components in membranes are phospholipids (forming basic matrix of the membrane) and proteins, embedded in the membrane or loosely attached to the surface. Another component are carbohydrates, attached to the membrane lipids and proteins. We will see how all three of these form a biological membrane and their usage.

# Biological Membranes Are a Mosaic of Lipids, Proteins, and Carbohydrates
  - The framework of the membrane is a phospholipid bilayer
    - Phosphoolipids are amphipathic, having a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head
    - The hydrophobic tails are in the interior and the heads are on the surface
    - Membranes also have proteins, with most having Carbohydrates attached to the lipids and proteins
