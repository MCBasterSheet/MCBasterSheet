> The Two Primary components in membranes are phospholipids (forming basic matrix of the membrane) and proteins, embedded in the membrane or loosely attached to the surface. Another component are carbohydrates, attached to the membrane lipids and proteins. We will see how all three of these form a biological membrane and their usage.

# Biological Membranes Are a Mosaic of Lipids, Proteins, and Carbohydrates
  - The framework of the membrane is a phospholipid bilayer
    - Phosphoolipids are amphipathic, having a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head
    - The hydrophobic tails are in the interior and the heads are on the surface
    - Membranes also have proteins, with most having Carbohydrates attached to the lipids and proteins

    - This is the fluid-mosaic model as the memebrane exhibits fluid properties due to lipid and proteins moving relative to one another within the membrane
      - Made by S.Jonathan Singer and Garth Nicolson in 1972
    - Each half of a phospholipid bilayer is a leaflet
      - Each plasma membrane contains a cytosolic leaflet and an extracellular one
      - They are assymetrical
        - One being how glycolipids (lipids with carbs attached to it), found on the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane, have the carbohydrate protion of a glycolipid extend into the extracellular medium
      - Some leaflets are more abundant compared to one another
# Proteins Associate with Membranes in Three Different Ways
  - The protein component carries out many key functions:
    - E.g. Membrane proteins in smooth ER functions as enzymes to break down glycogen
    - Also used in transporting ions and molecules across membranes (covered later)
    - Also important in ATP synthesis, photosynthesis, cell signaling, and cell-to-cell adhesion

  - Membrane proteins have three different ways of associating with a membrane
    - Transmembrane proteins have one+ regions physically embedded in the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer. The transmembrane segments are stretches of nonpolar amino acids spanning/traversing the membrane one leaftlet to another. For most segments, they are also folded into an alpha helix, and is stable because the nonpolar amino acids interact with the nonpolar lipid tails
    - Lipid-Anchored Protiens associate with a membrane as it has lipid molecules attache dto the amino acid side chain. The lipids are able to keep the protein snugly fit into the hydrophobic part of the membrane. This, along with transmembrane proteins are integral membrane proteins as they cannot be released from the membrane unless if the membrane is completely dissolved
    - Peripheral Membrane Proteins do not interact with the hyhdrophobic interior, rather they noncovalently attach to regions of the intergral membrane proteins projecting from the membrane or to the heads of a phospholipid. Usually they use hydrogen/ionic bonds to attach to the membrane

# Core Concept: 20-30% of All Genes Encode Transmembrane Proteins
  - As trasmembrane proteins participate in important cellular activities, research found that cells devote a sizable fraction of their energy and metabolic machinery to synthesizing membrane proteins
    - They are important enough to have 70% of all medications exert their effects by binding to membrane proteins (e.g. asprin binding to cyclooxygenase, a protein in ER membrane synthesizing chemicals in pain and inflammation)
  - To find out how many genes encode transmembrane proteins, they used tools to predict the likelihood of a gene encoding a transmembrane protein
    - They do this by ananlyzing an amino acid's tendency to enter a hydrophobic or hydrophilic environment
    - They then use these chracteristics to see how hydrophobic an amino acid sequeence is, and if a 18-20 amino acid sequence is mainly hydrophobic amino acids, then we can conclude (with experimentaiton) that it is a transmembrane alpha helix protein.
  - The results found 20-30% of all genes encoding for transmembrane proteins, in nearly all domains of life (Archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes)
