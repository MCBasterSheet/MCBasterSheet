 Thank you. Thank you. The biology teacher conference thing that I was out of town for the last few days was in Tucson, Arizona. And after one of our sessions, we had a little opportunity to, if you wanted to, nobody forced you to do this, take a hike into the beautiful Sonoran Desert at the foothills of the Catalina Mountains. It was absolutely amazing. We got up to a certain point. I actually took this picture. We got up to a certain point, and at that height, there was this rock that was 5,280 feet long. And the guy that we were on said that he congratulated us on reaching that milestone. 5,280 feet in a mile. Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Monday to you all. Welcome to the homestretch of MCB 150, right? We don't have much left. This is lecture 33 out of only 40 lectures. So we are really getting close to the end. I want to start today's class addressing the exam that you took before the weekend. I want to put this into context. I want to put this into historical context. Well, actually, first I want to talk about how your class is doing this semester. Then I want to talk about how your semester is doing compared to everybody else. There is the distribution of averages on your first three exams. It is an amazing bell curve, as you would imagine, with such a large sample size, and the median and median hover around in that C, C- range. Technically, it's on the C- side if we want to be specific about it. But this is sort of what we would expect. You're showing a nice distribution, and we've got some high performers in the semester, and we've got some people who are still maybe figuring out what's going to work for them. So this looks solid to me, and when I compare these numbers with where we are at the third quarter in every one of the last 20 semesters where we have been using exams, look at how steady that is. So what does this mean to me? It means that you are right where everybody else is. Now, I also love the fact that it's generating conversation. I'm not sure whether you're happy or sad about that. Let me remind everybody that these exams only account for 60% of your total course grade. Remember, 25% of your grade, 25% comes from the homework and learning catalytic stuff, that there's really no reason why you shouldn't be getting all of those points. And another 15% comes from discussion. Again, if you're there, you're present, you're engaged. You're going to be getting at least most of those points. So even with exam averages in the C- range, which sounds harsh, we know how hard MCB 150 is, we know what the demands are of this course, and we budget in points that are earnable outside of an exam scenario, outside of an exam setting. Now, I also feel like I should acknowledge some things. It's tough being a college student. It always has been, but I suspect that it's maybe a little more challenging now than it was when I was in college. I wasn't trying to do near the number of things that the average MCB 150 student is trying to do. I understand the demands on your time. I know that college is demanding, and you have these extracurricular activities. I get it that it's late in the semester. You're starting to run out of energy. I understand. I empathize with all of these things. I've had very recent conversations with some of you that the impression that I get is that you're still holding out hope that what worked for you in high school is going to work for you now. And I think we've seen as a group through three exams in this class that that's not realistic. So the expectations are different, and the approach has to change. And if you haven't made that adjustment yet, it's time. It's not too late, but it's time. And I want to very, very quickly, and just for a second, go back. If you're looking for, well, what would I do in terms of making any kinds of changes, remember that in our module section, right up at the very top under administrative information and help, there's this link, how do I do well or better in MCB 150. These are strategies that will help students change the way they approach biology. I promise you right now, I'm not asking for more, I'm asking for different. It has to be different than what you've done before. Now, my exam questions are challenging because they're not regurgitation questions. And it is possible that if you are still new to upper-order thinking, higher-order thinking questions, I don't ask you to regurgitate. I ask you to apply what you've learned. I ask you to evaluate statements. I ask you to analyze data or experimental scenarios. I ask a lot of higher-order thinking of you. And if you're not used to those kinds of questions, then it's possible that you look at an exam question and say, I don't even know what this is asking me, much less what the right answer is for the question. The way you get better at that is the way you get better at anything. You practice it. You understand how to look at a question like that. Unpack it so that you can see what the question is actually asking you and then apply what you learned along the way. If it seems like I have been begging you to come to office hours, it's because I do. I beg you to come to office hours. But I want to make a special invitation. This Wednesday, during my student hours, 4 o'clock to 5.30, what I would really like to do, we can answer whatever content questions you have. It's not going to be a wildly different experience. But anybody who's still struggling to figure out how to do well on these exams, I encourage you, I invite you, I beg you to come to Wednesday student hours and we'll walk through several questions, maybe all of them if we have time, on the exam. I want to show you what my anticipation was of your thought process. I want to tell you, this is what I was hoping you were thinking when you read this question. I don't think this is too late in the semester to do this, but understand we do still only have one large assessment left. That's the final exam. It is worth the same number of points that your other exams have been worth, 150 points. So it's no more or less weighted than any of the other exams. And if you get good at unpacking higher order thinking questions, that's not just gonna help you finish strong in MCB 150, it's a foundation that you can use to build in your other classes. Because listen to me, you can do this. Every person in this room can do this. What we need to do as educators and support is to show you that you can. You just need to taste a little bit of success. I think you'll find that it suits you. So let's get good at this and I can help you get good at this, but it does require a change of approach. What you did before isn't going to help as much anymore, at least not in this course. And I think I can say that's safely true of any stem course at U of I is just not rinse and repeat. It's just not regurgitation and memorization. All right, so you can do it. We can have a commercial. Who says that somebody's some businesses slogan is you can do it. We can help. I forget, but sound like a commercial here. So be it. Whatever, whatever helps you understand that we want you to do better and we believe that you can do better to begin lecture content. I want to return to the lack of tutorial that we started but did not finish. All right, let me make this full screen. Just as a very quick reminder, we started talking about negative regulation. We have not yet talked about positive regulation in the lac operon. The negative regulation of the lac operon is the presence of a repressor protein, which can be lifted when the inducer molecule is there. The inducer molecule is the sugar itself. When lactose is absent, we don't want to be making the lac operon gene, so we enable, we establish negative regulation, and we get very little. It is leaky. Remember the dial, which goes from 0.5 to 10, can't be turned all the way down to zero. It's a little bit leaky. You get a little bit, but when lactose is present, now we want to be making the tools to use lactose as a food source. We do that by lifting negative regulation, and we're going to talk in a moment about positive regulation, but the point I want to make right now is a very important one. Lifting negative rate regulation does not equal positive regulation. There is a system of negative regulation that involves the inducer molecule lactose It involves the repressor protein involves the operator region and the story Those are the only players in that conversation about negative regulation There's also positive regulation when you lift negative regulation You can turn the dial up to three or four, but you can't turn it all the way up to ten You can only turn it up to ten when in addition to lifting negative regulation you enact positive regulation on top of that So lifting negative regulation is not positive regulation. Those are different players That's a different conversation and it comes down to energy preferences. Remember the glucose preference So if we have any coli cell and it's presented with a lactose source and a glucose source Okay, maybe it finds a lactose first and it's like, nah, I don't like this. So it finds the glucose source, oh yeah, that's good stuff. And then it's gone and then finally you can see it's kind of, meh, it'll finish it off and then it's full. Alright, so when you have the choice of glucose or some other sugar, you're going to use up the glucose first. Glucose is keeping you from turning the dial up to 10. Glucose has no say in negative regulation one way or the other. Remember, it wasn't even part of that conversation. Negative regulation is the operator region bound by a repressor protein which can be lifted by lactose. Glucose wasn't part of that story, but glucose can keep you from turning on positive regulation if it is present. So how does that happen? Well, we get a few different molecules involved. Cyclic AMP, yes, that same cyclic AMP, except that now we're not talking about it being a eukaryotic second messenger. We're talking about it being a bacterial activator, and then a protein that it works with. I made this animation over 25 years ago, and at the time it was more prevalent to call the associated protein CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein. People still do sometimes call it that, but more people, including your textbook, call it CAP, catabolite activator protein. It's the same molecule. It's the same protein. This animation was made when we were mostly calling it CRP, but we do make a note in there at certain points that CRP and CAP are the same thing. Just wanted to point out that this isn't yet another molecule that you haven't seen. This is the CAP that's talked about in your book. All right, so what's going on here with positive gene regulation? We need to give RNA-Planarase help. That's the bottom line. Just because you have an accessible promoter doesn't make it a strong promoter. Remember our lectures on transcription where we talked about core promoter sequences, and in bacteria it was a minus 10 site, a minus 35 site, and there are very, very specific bases, TATAAT, TTGACA. There are specific bases that the sigma factor is looking for, and I mentioned at the time, if you start to deviate too much from those sequences, those consensus sequences, you lose your effectiveness as a promoter. Yes, you're there, but every once in a while RNA-Planarase just simply doesn't recognize you, and the LAC promoter is a fairly weak promoter. The more you deviate from the consensus sequence, the more we call you a weaker and weaker promoter, and the LAC promoter, honestly, is fairly weak. Which means just because it's open and accessible doesn't mean I'm going to do a good job of doing anything with it. If I had some help that could help RNA-Planarase recognize, yeah, I know this doesn't look like what you're looking for, but it really is, go ahead and load on here, that's going to kick things up. You overcome the limitation of having a weak promoter by enacting positive regulation. So lifting negative regulation just makes the promoter accessible. Cyclic AMP and CAP make the promoter stronger. Now, they don't change the genetic sequence. They just increase the level of transcription by informing RNA-Planarases that it really is a promoter. So that's what's going on here. Why isn't that always happening? Because cyclic AMP levels are inversely proportional to glucose levels. So think about that for a second. And why? Because of our friend, our weirdly named friend, adenylil cyclase. Yeah, bacteria have that too. Adenylil cyclase does the same thing in E. coli that it does in you and me. It changes ATP into cyclic AMP. That's what it does. Adenylil cyclase happens to be inhibited by glucose. So if you've got a lot of glucose around, you're not churning out any appreciable levels of cyclic AMP because you've inhibited adenylil cyclase. If for some reason the glucose was gone, then your adenylil cyclase is now fully active and it's churning out molecules of cyclic AMP. So there's your connection between glucose and the regulation of a lactose operon, which wouldn't seem to have any direct connection to it. It's because of that inverse relationship between glucose and cyclic AMP levels. So there's the structure we're going to... cartoon form, show it as a little pink diamond here. So that's the cyclic AMP molecules. As glucose levels fall, cyclic AMP levels rise. Now that CAP or CRP, that protein, cyclic AMP is a nucleotide, it's a modified nucleotide. CAP slash CRP, whatever you want to call it, that's a protein. And that protein is constitutively expressed. CAP is always around. But CAP can only do its job as an activator when it's bound to a molecule of cyclic AMP. So I'm only going to get positive regulation when I have them working as a team. They're only going to be available to work as a team if cyclic AMP is there. Cyclic AMP is only going to be there if glucose levels are low. And that leads to positive regulation of an alternate food source, operon. So here we go, RNA polymerase, I'm sorry, that's CAP or CRP, make a complex, they bind to yet another region of the promoter that, words, words, words, tells you that once that is bound there, it enhances the ability of an RNA polymerase to find that as a promoter. Now let's watch it. Picture's worth a thousand words, right? Let's watch this play out. I'm going to pause this for a second. If I don't have repressor protein in place, then I have an open, accessible promoter, but notice that every once in a while, the RNA polymerase just doesn't recognize it. Why? Because it's a weak promoter. Do we have a visitor in the room? Somebody or something. Sometimes we have squirrels get up there. Or bats. Oh, okay. Try not to be distracted by them. I was worried it was wildlife. I'm not worried about building crew with headlamps, but I was worried it might be a bat or a rodent of some kind, because we do occasionally have visitors in here. Alright, so, if I have lactose and glucose, have I lifted negative regulation? Yes. The sheer presence of lactose means I've removed the repressor protein from the operator sequence, I have an accessible promoter. If I have glucose and lactose, or I could use lactose and glucose, then in addition to having lifted negative regulation, do I also have positive regulation? If there's glucose around, what does the cell want to use? Glucose. So, if glucose is saying, I can't keep you from turning off negative regulation, but I can keep you from turning on positive regulation, Then in the presence of lactose and glucose, do I have positive regulation? No, I don't. So my promoter is accessible, but it's bad. It's, you know, by this standard, it's bad. And my levels of lactose polycystronic messenger RNA are going to be low. Now, let's say I use up my glucose by doing a lot of glycolysis. The levels of cyclic AMP rise. I've got this positive regulator that's now, now notice that every time an RNA polymerase is in the neighborhood, it gets loaded onto the promoter region. And this is the dial being turned up to 10. Before, when you had negative regulation lifted but no positive regulation, that was the dial at three or four. Now the dial's at 10. This is maximal expression because the conditions warrant it. When would you want to be making the most lac proteins possible? When you're out of your preferred food, but you have access to lactose. Presence of lactose, absence of glucose equals maximal expression. Dial turned up to 10. Alright, so we move forward, there's a little review stuff here. If I have lactose and glucose, glucose can't keep me from lifting negative regulation, but it can keep me from turning the dial up past 3 or 4. So what does that look like? High levels of glucose, no cyclic AMP, so no partners here, and a moderate amount of lacmRNA. If I remove the glucose, levels of cyclic AMP are going to rise, I get my partnership, they establish positive regulation, and boom, now I'm doing maximal expression of that. Now the question becomes, how do I reset the system? How do I turn off all of this regulation stuff and go back to the way it was? Well, you have to understand why it is the way it is now. If you want to know how you get back to it, you've got to understand why is it this way right now. I have opened my promoter region because there's no repressor protein down there. Why is there no repressor protein down there? Because its shape has been changed when lactose bound to it. How could I make it go back to its original shape, get rid of the lactose? Which, oh by the way, was the whole point in the first place. Being able to use lactose as a food source. What does that actually mean? It means taking this disaccharide and breaking the glycosidic linkage between the two monosaccharides and giving myself some glucose and galactose to do stuff with. And whose job was that, to act as the knife? That was BetaGal's job. So, as a reminder that this is making a polycistronic mRNA, which is... translated independently. We've lifted negative regulation, we make some lack polycistronic mRNA. Now ribosomes are gonna independently translate. Watch the beta-gal. Beta-gal comes over here, clips all of these lactose molecules, and this is E. coli eating lactose. Now I wanna play that again, I'm gonna do this replay, and instead of... I'll show you where to focus your attention, we're gonna focus on the repressor and its effect. Okay, so we make our repressor, we inactivate it with la- oh, we're not inactivating it. Okay, so now we inactivate it, promoter's accessible, I get the polycistronic mRNA, I make some beta-gal. Now once the beta-gal clips this lactose, watch the repressor. Its confirmation changes, it reestablishes negative regulation, and now no new mRNA can be made. I've reestablished negative regulation, I've turned off the operon, which is exactly what I wanted to do because I don't have any more lactose. There's no more signal out there that I have this available as a food source, so it makes perfect sense that I would want to shut it off. And then, why don't you just keep making it? Because the LAC mRNA gets broken down over time. I think that's the last slide in this. Yes, it is. This is already available on the website. If you are interested and have the software required to play a Shockwave flash file, then you can access that anytime. Alright, we're not done talking about the LAC operon, but we're done with the animated part of it. The next thing I want to mention is that we have a polycistronic mRNA that is independently translated. I can't say that often enough because it really throws people off. Just because I have all of my protein-coding genes on a single piece of mRNA doesn't mean I want to or need to make the same amount of beta-gal, LAC permease, and transacetylase. And in fact, I don't. If I'm E. coli, for every 10 molecules of beta-gal that I make, I only make 5 molecules of the permease, and I only make 2 molecules of the transacetylase. Now that's a head-scratcher at first. If it's all coming from the same individual single piece of mRNA, how could I possibly make different levels of protein from a single mRNA? Remember, they're independently translated, and I can be working on them simultaneously. So, if I affect the ability to make one of those proteins, I don't immediately affect the ability to make the rest of those proteins. So how can we do this adjustment? There's two different ways. Both of them very clever. One of them is at the level of messenger RNA stability. So this polycistronic mRNA, it's only going to be there for a couple of minutes. In bacteria, which have to constantly respond to changes in their environment, messenger RNAs are very short-lived. The half-life of a typical bacterial mRNA is only a couple of minutes. So most of your mRNAs are already on the clock once they've been made. In eukaryotes, just FYI, because our liver cells don't encounter wildly different conditions as much as a bacterial cell does, we can carry on with our mRNAs for maybe half an hour, a couple hours, but still, mRNAs have turnover. It just so happens that in the lac operon, you preferentially degrade from the 3' end. So that partly explains that 10 to 5 to 2 ratio. Here's how. Imagine I want you to visualize a very long mRNA that has its 5' end up here and goes all the way down here. And remember the order of the protein products. There's beta-gal over there, the lacZ gene. There's the lacY gene in the middle that codes for permease. And down here's the lacA gene that codes for the transacetylase. This is the 3' end of this super long mRNA molecule. If I start nibbling away from the 3' end, what's the first thing I'm going to cut into? The lacA gene. At that moment that I cut past the stop codon and into the reading frame of the lacA gene, am I going to be able to make any more functional transacetylase from this molecule at that point? No. But have I done anything to prevent making beta-gal in the meantime? No. They're independently translated. Have I done anything to keep from making more beta-gal? Not at the moment. They're independently translated. Eventually, I'm going to nibble past the lacA region into the lacY region, and at that moment, will I be able to make any more functional permease? No. But could I still be churning out beta-gal? Sure, why not? They're independently translated. Now eventually, I'm going to nibble all the way into the beta-gal region, the lacZ gene, and now I can't make anything from that mRNA. But it helps explain the 10 to 5 to 2 ratio. There's another reason why that ratio was established, and this one is at the level of translation initiation. There's a reason why I reintroduced this concept a moment ago of promoter strength. And consensus sequence. Remember how bacteria.
