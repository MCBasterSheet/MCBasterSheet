# Lecture Summary: Viral Replicative Cycles

## Introduction
- Viruses generally go through several steps, including attachment to cells and introduction of their genetic material.
- The nature of the virus's genome, whether RNA or DNA, dictates subsequent steps in the replicative cycle.

## DNA Viruses
- Most common DNA viruses are double-stranded DNA viruses, especially those infecting bacteria (phage).
- Two subdivisions within bacteriophages: virulent and temperate.
- Virulent phages follow a lytic cycle, commandeering host resources for rapid viral replication and cell lysis (e.g., T4).
- Temperate phages like lambda can choose between a lytic cycle or lysogeny based on cellular conditions.
- Lysogeny allows the viral genome to integrate into the host chromosome, potentially remaining dormant or progressing to the lytic cycle.

### T4 Replicative Cycle
- T4 introduces double-stranded DNA into host cells.
- Viral genome incorporates host's origin of replication, diverting resources to viral DNA replication.
- Viral genes encode proteins that degrade host chromosome and modify host RNA polymerase to prioritize viral gene transcription.
- Host resources are redirected to produce viral proteins and assemble new viral particles.
- Hundreds of new viral particles are released within about an hour.

### Temperate Phages
- Temperate phages like lambda can choose between lytic and lysogenic pathways based on cellular conditions.
- Lysogeny allows the virus to integrate its genome into the host chromosome, potentially remaining dormant.
- Lysogens are immune to further infection by the same phage.

## RNA Viruses
- RNA viruses require specialized mechanisms for RNA replication.
- Positive sense RNA viruses are directly translatable by host ribosomes upon entry into the cell.
- Negative sense RNA viruses require replication via viral replicase to generate positive sense RNA templates.
- Retroviruses reverse transcribe RNA into DNA using reverse transcriptase before proceeding with replication.

### Replicative Strategies
- Viruses replicate their RNA using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase), either brought into the cell or synthesized upon entry.
- Positive sense RNA viruses are immediately translatable, while negative sense RNA viruses require replication to generate translatable templates.
