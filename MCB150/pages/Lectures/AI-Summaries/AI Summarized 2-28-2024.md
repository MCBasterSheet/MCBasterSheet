## Ignorance or Apathy?
Thank you. Earlier today, I was running late for a meeting, and somebody stopped me anyway and said, "Hey, what's the difference between ignorance and apathy?" And I said, "Look, I don't know and I don't care. Thank you."

## Exam Reminders and Conflict Procedures
Good Afternoon and Happy Wednesday!
Welcome to MCB 150. I have some announcements to make, most of them reminders about the exam that's coming up.

- The exam is a week from tomorrow, Thursday, the 7th of March, from 7 to 9 p.m.
- Monday at 5 p.m. is the deadline for conflict exam requests for any reason.
- Exam locations are posted in Canvas, the same as the previous exam.
- Wednesday's material will begin exam three or unit three material.
- Exam two content concludes with today, Friday, and Monday's class.

## Practice Problems and Metabolism Reminders
Don't forget about the practice problems:

- Exam one practice sets contain metabolism questions.
- Exam two practice sets will be available soon.
- Be precise in recognizing intron-exon junctions for correct SNRP action.

## Intron Removal Mechanism and SNRPs
When we left off on Monday, we were discussing intron removal and SNRPs. Let's delve into the mechanics of intron removal:

- Intron-exon junctions are crucial, with the 5' and 3' splice sites.
- Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (SNRPs) remove introns and join exons.
- SNRPs recognize 5' splice site, invariant adenine near 3' splice site.
- A series of SNRPs bunch introns, cut at the 5' splice site, and form a lariat structure.
- The 3' splice site is cut, the lariat is released, and exons are covalently joined.

## Ribonucleoprotein Complexes and Intron Recognition
SNRPs are ribonucleoprotein complexes.

- RNPs include an RNA and protein component.
- Incorrect recognition leads to disorders like thalassemias.
- False splice sites result in defective proteins if recognition is incorrect.

## Alternative Splicing and Genome Complexity
Alternative splicing allows different combinations of exons.

- Relationship between genome size and complexity is not straightforward.
- Prokaryotes show a linear relationship between genome size and gene number.
- Eukaryotes, especially humans, demonstrate a more complex scenario.
- Alternative splicing allows diverse proteins from a limited number of genes.

## Size of Genomes and Number of Genes
Genome size does not directly correlate with organism complexity.

- The size of nematode worm and human genomes may differ, but the number of genes is comparable.
- Humans can make about 100,000 proteins from 21,000 genes due to alternative splicing.
- The average in humans is three to four different versions of a protein.

## RNA Processing: Capping and Tailing

### 5' Cap
- **RNA 5' Triphosphatase:** Removes one phosphate from the 5' end.
- **Addition of GTP:** Adds an upside-down guanine via a triphosphate bridge.
- **Methylation:** Methylates the guanine at the number 7 atom.
- **Result:** 5' 7-Methylguanosine cap (5' Cap): Essential for ribosome recognition and protects against exonucleases.

### 3' Poly-A Tail
- **Recognition Sequence (AAUAAA):** Marks the termination site.
- **Poly-A Polymerase:** Adds up to 300 adenines.
- **Result:** Poly-A Tail: Protects against exonucleases and aids in mRNA export.

## Purpose of Capping and Tailing
- **5' Cap:** Ribosome recognition, protection against exonucleases.
- **Poly-A Tail:** Protection against exonucleases, assists in mRNA export.
# Lecture Summary

## mRNA Processing and Transcription Termination
- **Poly-A Tail and 3' to 5' Exonuclease:**
  - A 3' to 5' exonuclease in eukaryotes nibbles away at the 3' end of processed mRNA.
  - This process involves adenine residues, but it's not crucial, more like nibbling at the "table" or tail.
  - The nuclease can be removed, and a fresh polyapolymerase molecule can extend the tail for continued RNA processing.
  - Poly-A tails also play a role in mRNA circularization for efficiency.
  - **Pun:** "Don't let the nuclease crash the RNA party – it's just nibbling at the table!"

- **mRNA Processing in Eukaryotes:**
  - mRNA processing involves intron removal, exon joining, 5' capping, and adding a poly-A tail.
  - These steps enhance mRNA stability and functionality.
  - This processing occurs in the nucleus, ensuring a mature mRNA for export to the cytoplasm.
  - **Pun:** "mRNA processing – making sure it's dressed up and ready for the cytoplasmic catwalk!"

## Transcription Termination and Catalytics Question
- **Transcription Termination:**
  - In bacteria, transcription and translation happen in the cytoplasm simultaneously, leading to no RNA processing.
  - Eukaryotes, with a nucleus, separate transcription and translation, allowing for mRNA processing before export.
  - **Pun:** "Bacteria are multitasking machines – no time for RNA dress-up!"

- **Learning Catalytics Question:**
  - A nucleotide, cortisepine triphosphate, lacks a 3' hydroxyl group, preventing further RNA chain extension.
  - It terminates transcription due to the absence of a crucial hydroxyl group for chain elongation.
  - The question emphasizes the importance of understanding nucleotide structure in transcription.
  - **Pun:** "No 3' hydroxyl? That's the 'chain'-ge in transcription termination!"

## Introduction to Translation and Genetic Code
- **Translation Overview:**
  - Transitioning from transcription to translation, focusing on converting mRNA information into proteins.
  - Proteins are made of amino acids, and mRNA provides the template for their sequence.
  - **Pun:** "Time to shift gears – moving from script to protein production!"

- **Genetic Code and Codons:**
  - Exploring the relationship between nucleotides and amino acids.
  - Discarding the idea of a one-to-one relationship due to the vast amino acid diversity.
  - Considering two and three nucleotide combinations, ultimately determining that a triplet code (three nucleotides per amino acid) fits the diversity of amino acids.
  - **Pun:** "Genetic code math – where 3 is the magic number!"

- **Nirenberg's Experiment:**
  - Marshall Nirenberg's groundbreaking experiment using in vitro protein synthesis to decipher the genetic code.
  - Proving the triplet code and identifying specific codons for amino acids, leading to the discovery of stop codons.
  - **Pun:** "Nirenberg's experiment – where 60 uracils lead to 20 phenylalanines and a code-breaking revelation!"

## Genetic Code Properties
- **Degeneracy and Redundancy:**
  - Introducing degeneracy or redundancy in the genetic code, where multiple codons can specify a single amino acid.
  - Emphasizing that this doesn't lead to ambiguity, ensuring unambiguous protein synthesis.
  - **Pun:** "Genetic code – a bit of redundancy, but no room for confusion!"

- **Non-overlapping Code:**
  - Clarifying that the genetic code is non-overlapping, read in triplets, providing clarity in amino acid assignment.
  - This ensures a systematic and predictable reading frame.
  - **Pun:** "Genetic code reads like a well-organized book – no overlapping chapters!"

- **Universal Genetic Code:**
  - Asserting the universality of the genetic code across species, despite some exceptions.
  - For the purpose of the course, exceptions are not considered.
  - **Pun:** "Genetic code diplomacy – universal language from E. coli to humans!"

- **Closing:**
  - Encouraging students to reach out during office hours for further clarification.
  - Wishing a great afternoon and signaling a pause in the lecture.
