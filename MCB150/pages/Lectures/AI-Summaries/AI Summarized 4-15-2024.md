# Biology Lecture Summary with Puns Galore

> The biology teacher conference thing that I was out of town for the last few days was in Tucson, Arizona. And after one of our sessions, we had a little opportunity to, if you wanted to, nobody forced you to do this, take a hike into the beautiful Sonoran Desert at the foothills of the Catalina Mountains. It was absolutely amazing. We got up to a certain point. I actually took this picture. We got up to a certain point, and at that height, there was this rock that was 5,280 feet long. And the guy that we were on said that he congratulated us on reaching that milestone. 5,280 feet in a mile. 

**# Deserts and Biology Converge:**
- *Why did the desert biologist always carry a camera? For photosynthesis.*
- *What did the biologist say when he found ancient DNA in the desert? It's a sand-erful discovery!*

# Happy Monday and Course Update

> Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Monday to you all. Welcome to the homestretch of MCB 150, right? We don't have much left. This is lecture 33 out of only 40 lectures. So we are really getting close to the end. 

**# Monday Motivation with Biology:**
- *Why did the biology professor always carry a microscope? For a closer look at Mondays.*
- *What did the biology student say when asked about the upcoming exam? It's time to cell-ebrate!*

# Exam Discussion and Historical Context

> I want to start today's class addressing the exam that you took before the weekend. I want to put this into context. I want to put this into historical context. Well, actually, first I want to talk about how your class is doing this semester.

**# Exam Blues with a Touch of History:**
- *Why did the biology student feel like he was in a time machine during the exam? Because he was studying for the past!*
- *What did the biology teacher say about the exam? It's time to put your cells to the test!*

# Exam Averages and Course Structure

> Then I want to talk about how your semester is doing compared to everybody else. There is the distribution of averages on your first three exams. It is an amazing bell curve, as you would imagine, with such a large sample size, and the median and median hover around in that C, C- range. 

**# Bell Curve Banter:**
- *Why did the bell curve fail the biology test? It couldn't find its median.*
- *What did the biology textbook say about exam averages? It's all in the DNA of the bell curve!*

# Course Components and Grading Breakdown

> These exams only account for 60% of your total course grade. Remember, 25% of your grade, 25% comes from the homework and learning catalytic stuff, that there's really no reason why you shouldn't be getting all of those points.

**# Grading Gab and Catalytic Quips:**
- *Why did the biology student bring a pencil to the learning catalytic session? To draw conclusions!*
- *What did the biology teacher say about homework grades? It's time to leaf through the genetic pages!*

# Student Challenges and Encouragement

> It's tough being a college student. It always has been, but I suspect that it's maybe a little more challenging now than it was when I was in college. 

**# Student Struggles and Biology Humor:**
- *Why did the biology student bring a ladder to class? To reach the higher branches of knowledge!*
- *What did the biology teacher say to the stressed student? It's time to chloro-fill your mind with positivity!*

# Exam Preparation Strategies

> Now, if you're looking for, well, what would I do in terms of making any kinds of changes, remember that in our module section, right up at the very top under administrative information and help, there's this link, how do I do well or better in MCB 150.

**# Study Tips with a Twist of Biology:**
- *Why did the biology student study in the garden? To absorb knowledge like a plant!*
- *What did the biology textbook say about study habits? It's time to fertilize your brain with information!*

# Higher-Order Thinking and Exam Challenges

> My exam questions are challenging because they're not regurgitation questions. And it is possible that if you are still new to upper-order thinking, higher-order thinking questions, I don't ask you to regurgitate.

**# Thinking Outside the Cell:**
- *Why did the biology student get an "A" on the exam? Because he had mito-studied hard!*
- *What did the biology teacher say about exam questions? It's time to evolve your thinking!*

# Office Hours Invitation and Final Exam Preparation

> If it seems like I have been begging you to come to office hours, it's because I do. I beg you to come to office hours. But I want to make a special invitation. This Wednesday, during my student hours, 4 o'clock to 5.30, what I would really like to do, we can answer whatever content questions you have.

**# Office Hours and Exam Prep:**
- *Why did the biology student visit the professor's office? To cyto-meet for exam advice!*
- *What did the biology teacher say about office hours? It's time to cell-abrate your learning journey!*

# Lac Operon Discussion: Negative Regulation
