# Lecture Transcript: Cell Cycle Dynamics

## Introduction:

- "Last night at dinner, my son made some comment about communism that he thought was hilarious. And I said, Ben, let me make something very clear to you right now. Jokes about communism aren't funny. Unless everybody gets them."
- "Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Wednesday to you all. Welcome to MCB150."

## Cell Cycle Overview:

- "As with any cycle, no beginning, no ending, just a point at which you, the observer, choose to begin to observe it."
- "We're gonna, and I also introduce this idea that often when we study something that can be different in different places that we look at it, we kind of need to have a common ground model organism or model system."
- "When we're talking about numerical data associated with the cell cycle, our frame of reference, unless you're told otherwise, is going to be cultured human cells."
- "How long do cells spend in G1, in S, in G2, in M? Well, it depends on the cell."

## Cell Cycle Phases:

### G1 Phase:
- "In our friends, the cultured human cells, the ones that take 24 hours to divide, they spend about half their time, 11 of those 24 hours, almost half the time, is in G1."
- "Once you transition into S-phase, then it's going to take a solid 8 hours to finish S-phase."
- "Once you do, once you transition into S-phase, then it's going to take a solid 8 hours to finish S-phase."

### G2 Phase:
- "Those preparations come in the form of what we call the second gap phase, or G2. That usually takes about four hours."

### M Phase:
- "We lightning fast go through M-phase. One hour out of a 24-hour life cycle is spent in M-phase."

### Cell Cycle Regulation:
- "Most of the cells approach this thing called the restriction point. It's a checkpoint in G1."
- "If all of your cells were allowed to just keep growing, your internal organs would just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and your skeleton wouldn't necessarily keep up with that, and you would explode from the inside out."

## Mitosis and Cytokinesis:

- "This is when you can look at a cell and see cool stuff happening."
- "Once again, the convention is held where the tubulin is stained green, the chromatin, the DNA, is stained blue."
- "Then finally the cytoplasm can divide, we've got ourselves two cells."

### Mitosis Phases:
- "We're gonna start mitosis now understand that the bullet points on this slide are not exhaustive of M phase."
- "We start mitosis with prophase then we do this thing this molecular ballet of moving chromosomes around."
- "The ballet itself is called chromatophase."
- "Once everybody's lined up in the middle, that imaginary line in the middle of the cell is called a metaphase plate."
- "You're not at metaphase until the last horse crosses the finish line in this race."
- "Once they're all there, you are now officially in metaphase, and now it's time to leave metaphase."
- "As we go to the next half of this, the separation of those sister chromatids is called anaphase."
- "Then, because we had to reach those chromosomes by breaking down the nuclear envelope, we've got to put the nuclear envelope back together."

### Visualization of Mitosis:
- "This next figure just shows the whole thing in one picture that doesn't add any new detail."

## Conclusion:

- "That's a descriptive trip through the cell cycle."
- "This is a cell that's in interphase. I can't make out any individual chromosomes."
- "Then one last trip through the cell cycle, this one using individual really cool, I think anyway, fluorescence images showing what's going on."

# Cell Cycle and Nuclear Dynamics

- **Introduction to Anaphase**: Anaphase is the phase where sister chromatids are separated. The reason for their attachment throughout the cell cycle is to ensure they stay together until this moment. Breaking the structure that separates them allows them to move to opposite sides, known as anaphase. Initially, there's some overlap between the chromatids, but they eventually fully separate. 

- **Telophase and Cytokinesis**: In telophase, the nuclear envelope reforms, and DNA relaxes. Spindle fibers depolymerize in preparation for cytokinesis, the process of cell division. Fluorescence microscopy reveals structures based on what's stained. Without staining for actin, contractile rings aren't visible, but they are present.

- **Cell Nucleus Components**: The nucleus consists of the nuclear envelope, nuclear pore complexes, and the nuclear lamina made of lamin proteins. These components are held together by non-covalent bonds, allowing for reversible interactions.

- **Phosphorylation in Nuclear Dynamics**: Phosphorylation events and other mechanisms lead to the fragmentation of the nuclear envelope, creating vesicles. Phosphorylation alters molecule interactions, causing components to separate temporarily without breaking them.

- **Telophase Reassembly**: In telophase, phosphorylation events are reversed, reassembling the nucleus. Vesicles fuse back together around DNA, forming a new double membrane structure. Nuclear pore complexes and lamin proteins regain their positions, restoring the nucleus.

- **Kinetochore Function**: Kinetochore is a protein aggregation on centromeres, interacting with microtubules during M phase. It attaches to microtubules and facilitates chromosome movement. Motor proteins within kinetochores regulate microtubule dynamics.

- **Microtubule Dynamics in Mitosis**: Microtubules are reorganized during mitosis to form the spindle apparatus. Different classes of microtubules, such as astral, polar, and kinetochore microtubules, serve distinct functions based on their location and interactions with motor proteins.

- **Anaphase A and B**: Anaphase A involves separating sister chromatids towards opposite poles, primarily driven by dynein motor proteins. Anaphase B entails moving spindle poles away from each other, involving the action of both dynein and kinesin motor proteins.

This transcript provides detailed insights into the dynamics of the cell cycle, focusing on key processes like anaphase, telophase, and the reassembly of the nucleus. It also delves into the components of the cell nucleus, emphasizing the roles of phosphorylation and motor proteins in nuclear dynamics. Additionally, the functions of different classes of microtubules and their interactions with motor proteins are elucidated, particularly in the context of anaphase A and B.
