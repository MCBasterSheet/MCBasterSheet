# Carbohydrates and Linkages in Biology

In the latest class discussion, the focus shifted to isomers, emphasizing that visual similarities between molecules do not necessarily indicate isomerism. True isomers share the exact chemical formula, and a case in point was presented with two vital biology molecules - ribose and deoxyribose. While they appear similar, a detailed examination revealed differences in their chemical formulas, showcasing the precision required in biology.

## Ribose and Circularization
Ribose, a monosaccharide pentose sugar, was explored, along with the process of circularization. The lecture reiterated the importance of recognizing the hydroxyl groups' positions, specifically emphasizing the distinction between ribose and deoxyribose. These sugars play a crucial role in building DNA and RNA, showcasing the significance of even subtle chemical variations in biology.

## Five-Carbon Sugars and Circularization
The discussion extended to five-carbon sugars, highlighting the existence of aldehyde and ketone groups in their straight chain forms. Ribose's circularization, forming a five-membered ring, was explained based on its five-carbon backbone. The lecture touched upon ketone five-carbon sugars, which, although not covered extensively, were deemed irrelevant for the course.

## Glycosidic Linkages
Transitioning to the practical applications of monosaccharides, the lecture introduced glycosidic linkages. The covalent bond formed between two monosaccharides was termed a glycosidic linkage, emphasizing its significance in carbohydrate interactions. Specificity in nomenclature was stressed, leading to the introduction of the term "1,4 glycosidic linkage," providing a precise description of the linkage between two monosaccharides.

## Disaccharides and Biological Relevance
The concept of disaccharides was explored through the example of maltose, a glucose-based disaccharide with an alpha 1,4 glycosidic linkage. The importance of differentiating between alpha and beta configurations was highlighted, as it significantly impacts biological behavior. Additional examples, such as cellobiose and lactose, illustrated the diversity and relevance of disaccharides in biological processes.

## Examining Disaccharides
The lecture delved into the examination of disaccharides, presenting diverse scenarios involving glucose, lactose, and sucrose. The impact of different configurations and linkages on biological behavior was underscored, showcasing the intricate relationship between chemistry and biology.

## Application-Based Questions
A practical application question involving galactosemia explored the understanding of glycolipids and glycoproteins. The lecture emphasized the real-world implications of carbohydrate modifications and their role in human health, encouraging critical thinking.

## Polysaccharides and Terminology
The lecture introduced the term "oligosaccharides," defining them as structures with three to twenty monosaccharides. The differentiation between oligosaccharides and polysaccharides was clarified, simplifying the categorization for future reference. The significance of modifying carbohydrates through covalent linkage to proteins and lipids, leading to glycoproteins and glycolipids, was highlighted.

## Blood Type and Glycoproteins
The role of glycoproteins in blood typing was elucidated, demonstrating how oligosaccharides on red blood cells determine blood types. The analogy of house numbers was used to explain why carbohydrates are positioned on the cell's outer surface, aiding in cell identification and communication.

## Glycolipids and Glycoproteins in Cell Membranes
The lecture concluded with a discussion on the placement of glycolipids and glycoproteins in cell membranes. The asymmetry in their distribution, concentrated on the cell's outer side, was rationalized by the need for external identification. The lecturealso had a Q&A session, addressing student queries related to covalent bonds and terminology. (Human intervention, covalent bond requires help to break)

# Introduction
In this molecular biology class transcript, the focus is on carbohydrates, specifically modified carbohydrates. The discussion begins by addressing the RH factors, clarifying their irrelevance to sugar components. The emphasis shifts to A positive or A negative blood types as examples for the placement of sugars on cell surfaces. The class aims to explore modified carbohydrates and their role in molecular biology.

# Carbohydrate Modification
The class delves into the modification of carbohydrates, mentioning the addition of functional groups, as illustrated in Table 3.1. Fructose is used as an example, with attention to carbon numbering. A modified version, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, is introduced, highlighting the significance of phosphorylation at specific carbons.

# Naming Conventions
An interesting discussion arises on nomenclature, distinguishing between di- and bis-phosphate. The prefix "bis" is explained, indicating non-covalent linkage between phosphates. The class anticipates encountering various molecules with different phosphate arrangements, leading to the use of monophosphates, diphosphates, and triphosphates in future discussions.

# Modified Glucose
The transcript then explores the modification of glucose and galactose, illustrating how replacing hydroxyl groups with amino groups transforms them into glucosamine and galactosamine. These modifications hold biological significance, contributing to the formation of chitin and certain components of cartilage.

# Polysaccharides
Transitioning to polysaccharides, the class categorizes them into two primary functions: energy storage and structural compounds. The three major polysaccharides discussed are cellulose, starch, and glycogen.

# Cellulose
Cellulose is highlighted as the most abundant organic molecule on Earth, forming plant cell walls. The structure is explained, emphasizing beta 1,4 glycosidic linkages, and how hydrogen bonds contribute to the stability of cellulose fibers.

# Starch
Starch, utilized by plants for energy storage, is compared to cellulose. The discussion focuses on alpha 1,4 linkages in unbranched amylose and the introduction of alpha 1,6 linkages in branched amylopectin. The helical structure of starch molecules is explained.

# Glycogen
Glycogen serves as an energy storage polysaccharide in animals. Similar to starch, it consists of alpha 1,4 linkages but is more extensively branched with alpha 1,6 linkages. The differences in branching between starch and glycogen are attributed to evolutionary adaptations.

# Conclusion
The class concludes by engaging students in a learning catalytic problem, testing their understanding of glucose structure. The professor provides guidance to address common misconceptions, fostering collaborative learning.
