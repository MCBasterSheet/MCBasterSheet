> MCB150 Lecture Transcript Summary

# Introduction
Happy Monday! The lecturer opens the session, expressing hope for a great weekend. The weekend included attending a friend's wedding where two Wi-Fi engineers got married. The reception was fantastic.

# Exam Announcement
The focus shifts to MCB150 course matters, and an important announcement is made regarding the first exam. It's scheduled for next week on Thursday, February 8th, from 7 to 9 p.m. Various rooms will host the exam based on the student's TA, with specific details available on Canvas.

# Semester Pace
The lecturer reminds students about the fast-paced nature of the semester, emphasizing the need to stay on top of the material. They reflect on the quick passage of time in college, urging students to prepare for the upcoming exam.

# Exam Content and Review
Details about the exam content are shared, indicating the last material to be covered on the Monday before the exam. The Wednesday before the exam will offer an optional review session.

# Biological Membranes - Selective Permeability
The lecture then delves into the topic of biological membranes, specifically addressing their selective permeability. The size and charge of molecules influence their ability to pass through the membrane, with emphasis on hydrophobicity and examples of molecules that can easily traverse.

# Biological Membranes - Fluidity
The concept of fluidity in biological membranes is introduced. Membranes are described as fluid, and an experiment of mice and human cells from the 1970s is referenced to demonstrate lipid movement. Lipid movement occurs through spinning, lateral shift, and transverse diffusion, the latter being facilitated by enzymes like flipases.

# Biological Membranes - Fluidity and Stability Balance
The delicate balance between fluidity and stability in biological membranes is discussed. Tail length and saturation levels of phospholipids impact this balance. Shorter tails and increased unsaturation contribute to higher fluidity, while longer tails and reduced unsaturation lead to increased stability.

# Cholesterol's Role
Cholesterol's role in maintaining membrane fluidity and stability is explored. At low temperatures, cholesterol increases fluidity by disrupting interactions. Conversely, at high temperatures, cholesterol enhances stability by restricting movement. Cholesterol acts as an adaptable solution for maintaining membrane properties.

# Question and Answer Session
The lecture concludes with a question and answer session, where students participate in a question related to phospholipids' abundance in organisms living in Antarctica. The answer was shorter carbon chains and more kinks.

# Next Topic Preview
The lecturer concludes by introducing the next topic, nucleic acids, specifying DNA and RNA as the two main types.

# Introduction to Nucleic Acids

> In this transcript, the speaker introduces nucleic acids as macromolecules primarily known for information storage. While acknowledging their role in genetics, the discussion is kept generic, with an emphasis on nucleotides as the building blocks.

# Nucleotide Structure

> Nucleotides, the monomers of nucleic acids, consist of three components: nitrogenous base, five-carbon sugar, and phosphate group. The nitrogenous base can be a single or double ring structure, classified as pyrimidines (single ring) or purines (double ring). The terminology is highlighted as being generic.

> The generic structure is further detailed, and a numbering system is introduced, emphasizing the importance of the nitrogenous base in providing identity.

# Nucleoside and Nucleotide Specificity

> Nucleosides, consisting of sugar and nitrogenous base, form the basis for more specific terms. The addition of phosphates leads to nucleotides. The terms nucleoside monophosphate, nucleoside diphosphate, and nucleoside triphosphate are explained, providing specificity in describing the number of phosphates.

# DNA and RNA Differences

> Distinctions between DNA and RNA are discussed, focusing on differences in bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil) and sugars (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA). The naming conventions for nucleotides in DNA (DNTP) and RNA (NTP) are introduced.

# DNA and RNA Building Blocks

> Building blocks for DNA are deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (DNTPs), and for RNA, ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). The importance of three phosphates in the incoming building blocks is stressed.

# RNA and DNA Structures

> DNA is usually double-stranded, while RNA is usually single-stranded. The phosphodiester linkage is explained as the covalent bond forming between nucleotides during polymerization.

# Polymerization of Nucleic Acids

> The polymerization process involves a condensation reaction, producing a phosphodiester bond and releasing a water molecule. The requirement of three phosphates for energy is clarified, emphasizing the breakage of a pyrophosphate group.

# Nature of Nucleic Acids

> A final learning catalytic question addresses the existence of certain molecules in nature, encouraging understanding of naming conventions and molecular structures.
