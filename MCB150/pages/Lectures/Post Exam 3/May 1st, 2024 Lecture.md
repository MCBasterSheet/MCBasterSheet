It is the last one. I admit, sometimes I feel like this class is a hopeless mess that exists to ruin the lives of those who simply don't have the time or the simple aspect of skill to study and succeed. This year I have seen lots of evil, and this class was a cruel type. One that is cruel in a way that it isn't even trying to be. MCB150 is a natural evil like a natural disaster, where the suffering and death of people is a natural byproduct, where depressingly, to not help and to help is both the right answer. Truth be told, I believe this "mastersheet" never really helped anyone. 

Here is an address to those who believe in the father above, and question why this class is even allowed to stress, ruin, and destroy people, who could have even been the rare few who live righteously. Like children suffering from the cruel randomness and the forces of nature that plagues us, we are stranded in a class that whilst influenced and made worse partially by the free will of humans, is still a random event that has attacked our very mind, body, and soul. The only answer I could give you is that he weeps too for you. Paradise after death is not a reward for our good doings, rather it is the only way he could ever apologize for the suffering we experience while still staying righteous on Earth while ensuring that each human has the free will to not only maybe love him, but to have the real ability to genuinely love each other.
