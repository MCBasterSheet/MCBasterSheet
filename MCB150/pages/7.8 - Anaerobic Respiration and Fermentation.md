> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Describe how certain microorganisms make ATP using a final Electron Acceptor of the ETC that is not Oxygen
> 2. Explain how muscle and yeast cells use fermentaion to synthesize ATP under anaerobic conditions

> - Anaerobic environment lacks oxygen
  >   - Many Bacteria and archaea and some fungi exist in anaerobic environments but must oxidize organic molecules to obtain sufficient amounts of energy
  >   - This can include soil bacteria or bacteria in your ASS
> - In Exercise, muscles can also just take more oxygen than is delivered
> - Cells can use two different strategies in the absence of oxygen
  >   - One is using not O2 for final electron accepting, anaerobic respiration
  >   - The second approach is producing ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation only without any net oxidation of organic molecules, or Fermentation


# Some Microorganisms Carry Out Anaerobic Respiration
- Normally the ETC has cytochrome oxidase (IV) recognize O2 and reduces it to H2O.
- Some Bacteria just decided to use another Component IV and different molecule than Oxygen
  - E.g. E. Coli makes Nitrate reductase, using nitrate (NO3-) as the final electron acceptor of the ETC

> This process generates an H+ electrochemical gradient in three ways.
> 1. NADH dehydrogensase pumps H+ out of the cytoplasm
> 2. Ubiquinone picks up H+ in the cytoplasm and carries it to the other side of the membrane
> 3. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite consumes H+ in the cytoplasm
> Generating H+ electrochemical gradient with these three processes lets E. coli cells make ATP via Chemiosmosis under anaerobic conditions

# Fermentation Is Breaking Down Organic Molecules Without Net Oxidation
- Many organisms like animals and yeast use only O2 as the final electron acceptor
- Anaerobic conditions gives them two options
- One is to Make ATP via glycolysis (anaerobic or aerobic)
  - Issue is glycolysis requires NAD+ to make NADH
  - Under aerobic conditions, NADH is oxidized to NAD+ to make more ATP
  - But not under anaerobic conditions as NADH builds up and NAD+ decreases
  - Horrible for 2 reasons:
    - 1. High concentrations of NADH just freely donates electrons to other molecules and makes free radicals
      2. Decrease in NAD+ prevents Glycolysis from running to make ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation

## _Fermentation in Muscle Cells_
- When this NADH increase happens, the pyruvate from glycolysis is reduced to make lactate (uncharged or protonated form is lactic acid)
- Electrons to reduce pyruvate are derived from NADH which is turned into nAD+
- Now glycolysis can continue
- Lactate is secreted from muscle cells, and with enough oxygen after anaerobic conditions end, the lactate produced is taken by cells, converted back to pyruvate, used for energy, or taken by the liver and other tissues to make glucose

## _Fermentation in Yeast cells_
- Yeast cope with anaerobic conditions differently
- Metabolizing sugar under anaerobic conditions has pyruvate being broken to CO2 and a 2 carbon molecule called acetaldehyde
- Acetaldehyde is reduced by NADH to make ethanol, and NADH is oxidized to NAD+
  - Decrease NADH and increase NAD+ as a result
  - This prevents the harmful effects of high NADH concentration and allows glycolysis to continue
- Fermentation is the breakdown of organic molecules to harness energy without any net oxidation (no net removal of electrons)
- These pathways of glucose to lactate or ethanol are good examples of fermentation
  - Despite electrons being removed from glucose to make pyruvate and NADH, the electrons are donated back to an organic molecule producing lactate or ethanol
  - Therefore, no net removal of electrons from an organic molecule
- Compared to Oxidative phosphorylation, fermentation produces far less ATP for 2 reasons
    - 1. Glucose is not oxidized completely to CO2 and H2O
    - 2. NADH made during glycolysis cannot be used to make more ATP
    - Complete breakdown of glucose in oxygen yields 34-38 ATP
    - In Anaerobic conditions, it only yields 2 ATP
