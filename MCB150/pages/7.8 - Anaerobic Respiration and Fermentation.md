> # Learning Goals:
>   - 1. Describe how certain microorganisms make ATP using a final Electron Acceptor of the ETC that is not Oxygen
>   - 2. Explain how muscle and yeast cells use fermentaion to synthesize ATP under anaerobic conditions
> - Anaerobic environment lacks oxygen
  >   - Many Bacteria and archaea and some fungi exist in anaerobic environments but must oxidize organic molecules to obtain sufficient amounts of energy
  >   - This can include soil bacteria or bacteria in your ASS
> - In Exercise, muscles can also just take more oxygen than is delivered
> - Cells can use two different strategies in the absence of oxygen
  >   - One is using not O2 for final electron accepting, anaerobic respiration
  >   - The second approach is producing ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation only without any net oxidation of organic molecules, or Fermentation


# Some Microorganisms Carry Out Anaerobic Respiration
- Normally the ETC has cytochrome oxidase (IV) recognize O2 and reduces it to H2O.
- Some Bacteria just decided to use another Component IV and different molecule than Oxygen
  - E.g. E. Coli makes Nitrate reductase, using nitrate (NO3-) as the final electron acceptor of the ETC

> This process generates an H+ electrochemical gradient in three ways.
> 1. NADH dehydrogensase pumps H+ out of the cytoplasm
> 2. Ubiquinone picks up H+ in the cytoplasm and carries it to the other side of the membrane
> 3. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite consumes H+ in the cytoplasm
> Generating H+ electrochemical gradient with these three processes lets E. coli cells make ATP via Chemiosmosis under anaerobic conditions
