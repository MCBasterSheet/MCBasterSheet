> This is a more detailed discussion for glycolysis, the initial pathway for glucose metabolism

# Glycolysis Is a Metabolic Pathway That Breaks Down Glucose to Pyruvate
- Glykos, sweet; Lysis, splitting
- Breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate
- Occurs under aerobic conditions and without
- 1930s, Several German biochemists shown glycoysis being in ten steps with different enzymes catalyzing it
- This literally created biochemistry, studying chemistry of living organisms
- Common for bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes
  - Nearly Identical for All living species

- Ten Steps for Glycolysis
  - 1. Energy Investment phase: Two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and phosphates from the ATP molecules attach to glucose, converting to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Raises the free energy of Glucose to make it exergonic
    2. Cleavage Phase: breaks the Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, 6 carbon, and two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
    3. Energy Liberation Phase: Energy liberation phase produces 4 ATP, 2 NADH, 2 pyruvate.

    > They rely on glycolysis for ATP needs, and without a need for oxygen, they can function without oxygen

# Regulation of Glycolysis
- How do cells control Glycolysis?
- Controlled via availability of substrates like glucose, and by feedback inhibition
- Involves phosphofructokinase, catalyzing the third step in glycolysis (most rate limiting step)
- If a cell has enough ATP, feedback inhibition occurs
  - At high concentrations, it binds to the allosteric site to phosphofructokinase, making it inactive
  - Prevents breakdown of glucose and prevents overproduction of ATP


> # Core Concept: The Overexpression of Certain Genes Cause Cancer cdells to Exhibit High Levels of Glycolysis
> 1931, Otto Warburg found certain cancers using glycolysis for ATP production
> Healthy cells get ATP from Oxidative Phosphorylation
> This ist he Warburg effect
> They inject a patient with radioactive glucose analogue called Fluorodeoxyglucose and when taken by cells using a lot of glucose, they are bright in the PET scan

> Now how does this overexpression affect tumor growth?
> They find that increasing in glycolysis favors tumor growth due to the changes in Oxygen levels as they begin to have internal regions become hypoxic
> They NEED ATP and so they use glycolysis to not have to use oxygen
> So how to control? Target the ETC of cancer cells!
