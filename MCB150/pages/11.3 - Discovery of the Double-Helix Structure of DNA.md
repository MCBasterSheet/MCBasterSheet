# X-ray Diffraction Pattern Produced by Franklin
- X-ray diffraction was important as a tool to find the DNA double helix
  - When something is exposed to X-rays, the atoms in the substance cause the X-rays to be scattered
  - If the substance has a repeating structure, the pattern is scattering and the pattern is analyzed using mathematical theory to provide information regarding the 3D shape of the molecule
- Rosalind Franklin, in 1950 in the same area as Maurice Wilkins, did lots of X-ray diffraction techniques involving DNA
  - He found helical structure with a diameter that is relatively uniform and too wide to be single-stranded
  - The pattern also showed the number of nucleotides per turn and found a consistent spacing of 2 nm between the strands (either AG or TC)

# Base Composition Determined by Chargaff
- Erwin Chargaff, in 1950, analyzed the bas composition of DNA that was isolated from many species
- Showed amount of A = T and C = G

# Model Building by Pauling
- Early 1950s, more information was known about the structure of proteins than nucleic acids
- Linus Pauling proposed that some regions of proteins turn into an alpha helix
- To find out, he ,ade a large model with ball-and-stick units
- This lets him see if the atoms fit together properly in a 3d structure
- This approch is used today, but using 3d models instead on a computer
- Solved double helix

# Watson and Crick Deduced the Double helix Structure of DNA
- So far, we've found the experimental studies leading to the determination of DNA double helix.
- watson and Crick, in Cambridge, assumed Nucleotides are linked together in a linear fashion and chemical linkage between two nucleotides are always the same
  - They then built many ball and stick models to incorporate all of the known experimental observations
- These modelings involved lots of trial and error
  - made one with bases outside, h bonds with base and identical base (found purine purine too wide and pyrimidine and pyrimidine too narrow), they found that we need H-bonding of AT and GC
  - Both cases, AG bonding with T/C shown that the two strands would fit all the atoms together properly
- Then published in 1953 Nature journal and 1962 they were all 3 awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
- FRANKLIN FUCKING DIED BEFORE HAND AND NOBEL PRIZE ONLY TO LIVING PEOPLE
