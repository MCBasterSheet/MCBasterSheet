# Lecture Summary: Cellular Respiration and Glycolysis

## Introduction
- **Audience Interaction:** Silence with applause (indicating live lecture).
- Vehicle issue discussed: Airbags deployed unexpectedly, mechanic's expensive repair due to inflation.
- Welcoming students to MCB 150 on a beautiful Friday, expressing gratitude for attendance.

## Exam Discussion
- Exam-related announcements:
  - Exam results on Monday, answer key available on Canvas at 3 p.m.
  - Clarification on addressing exam-related questions to the course coordinator (Melissa) or the lecturer.
  - In-person discussions for exam-related queries, no electronic communication.

## Conflict Exam
- Instructions for conflict exam attendees to retrieve their exam booklets from the instructional program office.

## Handouts and Metabolism
- Grouping all metabolism-related handouts for clarity.
- Overview of upcoming lectures on cellular respiration.

## Cellular Respiration Introduction
- Breakfast discussion: Importance for energy, relating to the concept of ATP as the energy currency.
- Transition into discussing cellular respiration, the process of converting food into ATP.

## Phases of Cellular Respiration
- Cellular respiration involves three phases: Glycolysis, Pyruvate Oxidation/Krebs Cycle, and Oxidative Phosphorylation.
- Focus on understanding inputs, outputs, and locations rather than memorization.
- Each phase will be discussed with an emphasis on its significance in ATP production.

## Glycolysis Overview
- Definition: Glycolysis is the splitting of a sugar molecule, specifically glucose.
- Investment phase: Two of the first three steps are endergonic, requiring existing ATP.
- Importance of glycolysis across organisms and its occurrence in the cytoplasm.

## Glycolysis Steps
- Breakdown of glycolysis steps: 
  1. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate.
  2. Isomerization to fructose 6-phosphate.
  3. Addition of a second phosphate to create fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
  4. Cleavage into two 3-carbon molecules.
  5. Interconversion of the top molecule into an identical bottom molecule.
  6. Duplication of steps for both molecules.
- Emphasis on enzyme names indicating their functions.
