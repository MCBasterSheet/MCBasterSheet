> Like the immune system, the CRISPR-Cas system protects bacteria and archaea from foreign invaders, like bacteriophages and transposons (small segments of able to be inserted inot all species

> ncRNAs play a key role in the CRISPR-Cas system, half of all bacterial species and most archaeal species having this system

# The CRISPR-Cas System Provides Bacteria with Defense AGainst Bacteriophages
- Mojica and co first recognized different species of bacteria and archaea have a site of their chromosome (now called the CRISPR locus) containing repeated sequences
- Later, analyzing this locus let Mojica, Vergnaud, Bolotin to find it protects agianst bacteriophages
- This is due to it being derived from bacteriophage DNA, confirmed by the frenchie Philippe Horvath and co
- Below shows a common organization of the CRISPR-Cas system having 5 genes
  - *tracr, Cas9, Cas1, Cas2, and Crispr*
  - *Crispr* is a group of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (STOP MAKING FUCKING ACRONYMS)
  - Repeats and spaced with spacers the Crispr gene is
  - CRISPR-Cas Type II also has a gene making ncRNA called tracrRNA and a few protein-coding CRISPR-associated genes (Cas genes) usually adjacent to the *Crispr* gene
    - These genes needed to mediate the the defense against bacteriophages

- THe CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive defense because bacterial cells must be exposed to an agent to elicit a response. It requires 3 stages

## *Adaptation*
- Also called spacer acquisition, Adaptation occurs after exposure to bacteriophages
- Proteins from *Cas1 & Cas2* form a complex recognizing bacteriophage DNA as foreign and cleaves it into pieces
- A piece of bacteriophage DNA, usually 20-50bp in length, is inserted into the *Crispr* gene (WE HAVE NO CLUE HOW THIS IS DONE)
- Then this insertion is a new spacer because it spaces repeats, and different ones in *Crispr* of modern bacterial species are from previous infections
- Each Spacer provides the bacterium with defense against a particular bacteriophage, so this can even be passe donto daughter cells
- Cleaving Bacdteriophages into pieces lets the adaptation phase protect a cell, but expression and interference is better at this

## *Expression*
- Subsequent infection by bacteriophage will result in expression, which uses *Crispr, tracr, & Cas9* genes
- The *Crispr* gene is transcribed from a single promoter producing a long ncRNA called pre-crRNA with several repeat sequence by spacers
- Gene encoding of tracr RNA is also transcribed, making a lot of tracrRNA (also an ncRNA)
- A region of tracrRNA is complementary to the repeat sequences of ore-crRNA
- Several molecules base pair the two, and the pre-crRNA is cleaved into small molecules, now called crRNA, each attache dto a tracrRNA
- The region of tracrRNA recognizaed b the Cas9 protein, and now tracrRNA is a guide letting tracrRNA-crRNA complex to bind to a Cas9 protein
