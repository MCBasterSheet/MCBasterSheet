> # Learning Goal: Explain how ncRNA known as HOTAIR plays a role in gene repression

- Hox transcription antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is recently found in humans and other mammals that can alter chromatin structure and represses gene transcription
- It is encoded in the _HoxC_ genes and HOTAIR is named as it is transcribed from the opposite strand to the strand used for _HoxC_ genes
- Below shows the simplified mechanism for repression of gene transcription from HOTAIR, acting like a scaffold to bind two protein complexes to covalently modify histone proteins
  - One compelx binds to the 5` end of HOTAIR, other to the 3 prime end
  - HOTAIR guides them to a target gene by gbinding near the region rich in purines, the GA-rich region
  - E.g. HOTAIR binds to a GA-rich region next to a _HoxD_ gene

- It concludes iwith histone modifications, and modifications from HOTAIR are known for inhibiting transcription
  - Either it directl yinhibits the ability for RNA polymerase to transcribe the traget gene (prevent it from forming the preinitiation complex) or...
  - It attracts chromatin modifying enzymes to the target gene, leading to further changes in chromatin structure inhibiting transcription

- HOTAIR also just has a role in human disease, and certain types of cancer happens when HOTAIR is wrong
