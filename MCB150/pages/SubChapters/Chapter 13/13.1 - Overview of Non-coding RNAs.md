# ncRNAs Can Bind to Different Types of Molecules
- Re-read the header. Let that sink in
- 4 types of molecules are recognized by ncRNAs, some to DNA or RNA through complementary basepairing, some to proteins or other small molecules

- Like tRNAs, ncRNAs may make pockets on the surface of proteins or multiple stem loops may form a binding site for a small molecule
- A single ncRNA can contain multiple binding sites, so it can facilitate the formation of a large structure of multiple molecules, like ncRNA and three different proteins shown above

# ncRNAs Can Perform a Diverse Set of Functions
- Before we begin, lets see the common functions of ncRNAs

## *Scaffold*
- Some ncRNAs contain binding sites for multiple components, like a gorup of different proteins
- They can be the scoffold to form a complex (Refer to PEEPEEPOOPOO above)

## *Guide*
- Some mcRNAs guide a molecule to a location in the cell
- It is based on having a binding site for a protein and one for DNA

## *Alteration of Protein Function or Stability*
- Binding to a protein lets the ncRNA alter the protein structure, creating a variety of effects
- It can affect:
  - Protein's ability as a catalyst
  - Protein binding
  - Stability of the protein

## *Ribozyme*
- They can function as ribozyumes, RNA with a catalytic function
- Peptidyltransferase, large ribosomal subunit, catalyzes peptide bond during formation and an rRNA in it is the catalyst

## *Blocker*
- An ncRNA may physically prevent or block a cellular process from happening
> Bacteria has antisense ncRNA that is complementary to mRNA that can let it not be translated

## *Decoy*
- Some ncRNA recognize others and sequester them
- Decoy ncRNA can bind to different ncRNA called microRNA that can inhibit translation of particular mRNA (check later in chapter for more)
- If a decoy ncRNA binds to an miRNA, the miRNA cannot carry out its function

# Functions of some ncRNAs are Understood
- This remainder of the chapter will focus on functions of ncRNAs not discussed elsewhere. Also, here is a table to cover more
