> # Learning Goals
> 1. Describe the ability of ncRNAs to bind to other molecules and macromolecules
> 2. Outline the general functions of ncRNAs
> 3. Define ribozyme
> 4. List several examples of ncRNAs, and describe their functions
>
> ncRNA fied is expanding, and many have yet to be discovered. Also we got no clue of the certain names of ncRNAs or their functions
>
> Still, we got general features to cover, so we will take a look at the general features of ncRNAs and go to specific examples in greater detail... Later
