> The previous section, we were able to see how ncRNA affects the process of transcription. Recently, we found how ncRNAs exert effects on RNA molecules already made, so we see here how ncRNAs affect the ability for mRNAs to be translated or degraded.

# Feature Investigation: Fire and Mello Showed Double-Stranded RNA is more Potent Than Antisense RNA in Silencing mRNA
- Specific mRNAs can be targeted for translational inhibition or degradation by a mechanism involving double-stranded RNA, discovered via nemotode worm torture with Fire, Mello, and co on the *mex-3* gene

> Experiment: ![image](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/assets/157453648/b0e8fb8f-4270-4060-a6ae-0d4bdf0cba6c)

- *mex-3* gene was easy to use
  - RNA Polymerase, nucleotides, and plasmid is mixed, and *mex-3* mRNA is made, the normal sense strand along with an antisense strand by swapping promoter orientation. Mixing the sense and antisense strand made double-stranded RNA
  - These were injected into gonads of C. elegans, one of each then one of both
  - They probed the embryos to check for *mex-3*,  and found that the control had a lot of *mex-3*, antisense RNA decreased it, and double-stranded RNA had no *mex-3* mRNA detected
- This is **RNA intereference (RNAi)** and it describes this phenomenon
- This observation led researchers to investigate the molecular mechninisms, discussed next

# RNA Interference is Mediated by MicroRNAs, or Small-Interefering RNAs via the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex
- RNA interference is in most eukaryotes in MicroRNAs or small-interfering RNAs

## *MicroRNAs*
- ncRNAs transcribed from endogenous eukaryotic genes, genes normally found in the genome
- They play key roles in gene expression regulation, particularly during embryonic development in animals and plants
- 1 type of miRNA inhibits translations of several mRNAs, mainly because they just pair because they have base sequences that are partially complementary
- Humans have 2000+ genes encoded by miRNAs, and 60% of the human proteome are regulated by miRNAs

## *Small-Interfering RNAs*
- ncRNAs originating from sources that are exogenous, not normally made in cells
- siRNAs come from certain viruses containing double stranded RNA that infects a cell, or are synthesized experimentally
- The sense and antisense RNAs would have bonded to each other to make siRNA in the experiment we described above
- Most cases, siRNA perfectly match a certain mRNA, so the siRNA is hypothesized to play a key role in preventing certain viral infections
- siRNAs are also important experimental tools in molecular biology

## *RNA-Induced Silencing Complex*
- miRNA and siRNA can interfere RNA
- miRNA
  - First synthesized as pri-miRNA (primary-miRNA) in the nucleus
  - pri-miRNA folds into a hairpin structure with long single stranded 5` and 3 prime ends
  - The pri-miRNA is cleaved at both ends to make a pre-miRNA (precursor miRNA) then exported from the nucleus
- siRNAs
  - Not processed in the nucleus
  - Enters cytosol from outside of the cell from viruses or researchers
  - *mex-3* RNA from the experiment above is an example of pre-siRNA, made from two complementary RNA molecules base-pairing with each other
- Once in the cytosol, both pre-miRNAs and pre-siRNAs are cut by an endonuclease called dicer (see image below) releasing a double stranded RNA molecule 20-25 base pairs long
  - This double-stranded RNA associates with proteins to make the **RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)**
  - One strand of RNA is degraded, and the remaining single-stranded miRNA or siRNA is complementary to specific mRNAs needed to be silenced
  - miRNA or siRNA guides the RISC to recognize such mRNA molecules

- After RISC binds to mRNA, 2 things can happen
  1. RISC can inhibit translation without degrading mRNA, more common for miRNAs as they are complementary to their target mRNA
  2. RISC can direct degredation of mRNA, where one protein in RISC can cleave mRNA (usually for siRNA that are a perfect match for their target mRNA)
- The two effects are termed RNA interference because it literally does that
- RNA interference has 2 benefits
  - Important for regulation, and defends against viruses (usually used in plants)
