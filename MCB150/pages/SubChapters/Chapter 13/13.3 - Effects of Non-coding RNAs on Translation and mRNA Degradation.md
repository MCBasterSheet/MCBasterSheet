> The previous section, we were able to see how ncRNA affects the process of transcription. Recently, we found how ncRNAs exert effects on RNA molecules already made, so we see here how ncRNAs affect the ability for mRNAs to be translated or degraded.

# Feature Investigation: Fire and Mello Showed Double-Stranded RNA is more Potent Than Antisense RNA in Silencing mRNA
- Specific mRNAs can be targeted for translational inhibition or degradation by a mechanism involving double-stranded RNA, discovered via nemotode worm torture with Fire, Mello, and co on the *mex-3* gene

- *mex-3* gene was easy to use
  - RNA Polymerase, nucleotides, and plasmid is mixed, and *mex-3* mRNA is made, the normal sense strand along with an antisense strand by swapping promoter orientation. Mixing the sense and antisense strand made double-stranded RNA
  - These were injected into gonads of C. elegans, one of each then one of both
  - They probed the embryos to check for *mex-3*,  and found that the control had a lot of *mex-3*, antisense RNA decreased it, and double-stranded RNA had no *mex-3* mRNA detected
- This is **RNA intereference (RNAi)** and it describes this phenomenon
- This observation led researchers to investigate the molecular mechninisms, discussed next

# RNA Interference is Mediated by MicroRNAs, or Small-Interefering RNAs via the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex
- RNA interference is in most eukaryotes in MicroRNAs or small-interfering RNAs
