> # Learning Goals
> 1. Analyze experimental evidence that Double-Stranded RNA is more potent in silencing mRNA than antisense RNA is
> 2. Outline the steps of RNA interference
>
> The previous section, we were able to see how ncRNA affects the process of transcription. Recently, we found how ncRNAs exert effects on RNA molecules already made, so we see here how ncRNAs affect the ability for mRNAs to be translated or degraded.
