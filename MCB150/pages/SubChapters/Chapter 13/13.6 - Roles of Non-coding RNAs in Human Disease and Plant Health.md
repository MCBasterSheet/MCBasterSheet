> # Learning Goals:
> 1. List examples in which nsRNAs are associated with human diseases
> 2. List examples in which ncRNAs play a role in plant health
>
> - The last two decades has been consisting of researchers finding abnormalities in ncRNAs as the reason for a lot of human diseases
> - The first one found being cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) coming form an issues of a ncRNA transcribed from a nuclear gene
> - The effects of ncRNAs on plants have also been an interesting one in terms of agriculture, but in many cases we got not clue how the abnormalities contribute to disease states
> - This section focuses on the roles ncRNAs have in developing cancer, neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases as well as its effects on plant health

# ncRNAs Play a ROle in Many Forms of Cancer and Other Human Diseases
- ncRNAs play a role in chromatin modificaiton, gene transcription, mRNA translation, and protein function
- When certain ncRNAs are expressed abnormally (too high/too low of a level) these conditions can occur
  - These abnormal expression levels are caused by mutations in specific genes or via epigenetic change changing the expression of genes encoding ncRNAs.
