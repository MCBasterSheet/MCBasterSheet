> # Learning Goals:
> 1. List examples in which nsRNAs are associated with human diseases
> 2. List examples in which ncRNAs play a role in plant health
>
> - The last two decades has been consisting of researchers finding abnormalities in ncRNAs as the reason for a lot of human diseases
> - The first one found being cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) coming form an issues of a ncRNA transcribed from a nuclear gene
> - The effects of ncRNAs on plants have also been an interesting one in terms of agriculture, but in many cases we got not clue how the abnormalities contribute to disease states
> - This section focuses on the roles ncRNAs have in developing cancer, neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases as well as its effects on plant health

# ncRNAs Play a ROle in Many Forms of Cancer and Other Human Diseases
- ncRNAs play a role in chromatin modificaiton, gene transcription, mRNA translation, and protein function
- When certain ncRNAs are expressed abnormally (too high/too low of a level) these conditions can occur
  - These abnormal expression levels are caused by mutations in specific genes or via epigenetic change changing the expression of genes encoding ncRNAs.

## *ncRNAs and Cancer*
- The Role of ncRNAs in cancer has been studied in respect to miRNAs
  - Nearly all forms of cancer has differences in expression of miRNAs found between normal and cancer cells
  - Some genes that encode for miRNAs behave as tumor-suppressor genes as lower levels of expression of particular miRNAs allow tumor growth
  - Some cases certain miRNAs are oncogenes, and their overexpression promotes cancer
- One well studied one is miR-200
  - They prevent tumors byu inhibiting metastasis, how cancer cells spread along the body
  - Low levels lead to many types of cancer, including bladder, melanoma, stomach cancer, and colorectal cancer
- HOTAIR is another ncRNA highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancer.
  - Over expression leads to HOTAIR behaving as an onco gene
  - High levels of HOTAIR in breast tumors are a significant predictor of metastasis and death
  - HOTAIR interacts with a lot of cellular componenets, but the way it promotes cancer is not well understood

## *ncRNAs and Neurological Disorders*
- Many miRNAs are essential for proper development and functioning of the nervous system
- 70% of ncRNAs are expressed in the brain, many specific to neurons
- miRNAs involved in neuron growth and the overall development of the nervous system, where abnormal levels of miRNA expression are associated with nearly all neurological disorders where ncRNAs have been investigated
- The table I shown above describes some examples where miRNA expression altercations cause neurological disorders
  - E.g. Alzheimers diseases involves abnormally expressed miRNAs thought to be down-regulating enzyme beta-secretase, leading to overproduction of beta-amyloid peptides, the big thing about the disease
  - miRNAs also control the inflammatory process leading to MS

## *ncRNAs and Cardiovascular Disease*
- Abonormalitie sin miRNA has been linked to many cardiovascular disease
- miR-1 is associated with arrhythmias, irregularities in heartbeat
  - It regulates expression encoding ion channel proteins, signalersr for cardiac muscles cells
- Other miRNAs appear to play a role too, with arterial plaques being made from miR10a, miR145, and miR143

## *ncRNAs Are Essential for Plant Health*
- Plant biologists are finding ncRNA abnormalitie splaying an essential role to the health of plants
- Likely to impact agriculture a lot and let us modify plants
- Table below shows some examples
