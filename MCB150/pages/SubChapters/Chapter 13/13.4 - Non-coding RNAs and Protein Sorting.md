> # Learning Goals: Describe the Function of SRP, and explain the roles of SRP RNA with Regards to that Function
> - Proteins function at particular locations, some being extracellular and being secreted.
> - To do so, they are first **sorted in plasma membrane in bacteria and archaea** or to the **ER membrane in eukaryotes**
- Sorting of secreted proteins are done by a protein-RNA complex called the **signal recognition particle (SRP)**
  - Bacteria, SRP is one ncRNA and one protein
  - Eukaryotes, SRP is one ncRNA and 6 different proteins

- Image below show how it works in eukaryotes
  - Direction towards the ER membrane requires the polypeptide having an **ER Signal Sequence**
  - 6-12 amino acids that are <u>predominantly hydrophobic and located near the N-terminus<u>
  - As the ribosome makes a polypeptide int he cytosol, ER signal sequence would emerge and be recognized by a protein in the SRP
  - Binding SRP to a protein pauses translation
