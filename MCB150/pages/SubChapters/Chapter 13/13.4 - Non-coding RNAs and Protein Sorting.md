> # Learning Goals: Describe the Function of SRP, and explain the roles of SRP RNA with Regards to that Function
> - Proteins function at particular locations, some being extracellular and being secreted.
> - To do so, they are first **sorted in plasma membrane in bacteria and archaea** or to the **ER membrane in eukaryotes**
- Sorting of secreted proteins are done by a protein-RNA complex called the **signal recognition particle (SRP)**
  - Bacteria, SRP is one ncRNA and one protein
  - Eukaryotes, SRP is one ncRNA and 6 different proteins

- Image below show how it works in eukaryotes
  - Direction towards the ER membrane requires the polypeptide having an **ER Signal Sequence**
  - 6-12 amino acids that are <u>predominantly hydrophobic and located near the N-terminus<u>
  - As the ribosome makes a polypeptide int he cytosol, ER signal sequence would emerge and be recognized by a protein in the SRP
  - Binding SRP to a protein pauses translation

- SRP then binds to the SRP receptor in the ER membrane, docking the ribosome over the channel
  - This binding requires proteins in SRP and SRP receptor to the bound by GTP, where the GTP-binding proteins hydrolyze their GTP causing release of SRP and receptor and polypeptide
  - Releasal of SRP resumes translation and threads the polypeptide across the ER membrane
  - Secreted proteins, newly made polypeptides travel through the Golgi Apparatus then to the plasma membrane, released outside of the cell

- Two roles have been found for SRP RNA:
  - Being a scaffold for the binding of SRP protiens
  - After SRP binds to its receptor in the ER membrane, SRP RNA stimulates proteins in boht SRP and the SRP receptor to hydrolyze GTP (enhances GTPase activities so SRP is easily released)
