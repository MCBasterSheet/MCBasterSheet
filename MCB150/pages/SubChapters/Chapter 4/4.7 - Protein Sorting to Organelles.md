- For eukaryotes, we find that proteins have amino acid sequences directing them to the right cell location
- **Sorting Signals**, or **traffic signals**, recognized by specific cellular components facilitate the proper movement of proteins carries the signal to the right location
- Synthesis of most eukaryotic protiens happen in the cytosol on ribosomes
  - Using mRNA, cytosol provides amino acids to build up the proteins in translation.
  - Cytosolic proteins lack the sorting signal, remaining instead in the cytosol
- Synthesis of proteins for the ER, Golgi, Lysosomes, vacuoles, or secretory vesicles happen in the cytosol and halts until it binds to the ER membrane, then resuming translation inside the ER
  - This is **cotranslational as it is happening during translation**
- Most proteins int he nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes happen after the protein is already made.
  - This is **post-translational sorting** as it doesn't happen until the translation is finished

# Cotranslational Sorting of Some Proteins are in the ER Membrane
- Blobel conceived sorting proteins due to a discovery he and colleages found in the the form of sorting signals in protiens sending them bnack to the ER membrane, the first step in cotranslational sorting
- Direction to the rough ER membrane requires polypeptides with a sorting signal called an **ER Signal Sequence**
  - These are 6-12 amino acids in length, are predominantly **hydrophobic**, and located near the N-terminus of the polypeptide
- As the ribosome is making polypeptides, the ER signal sequence emerges from the ribosome and is recognized by a protein-RNA complex called a **signal recognition particle**
  - First, recognizes ER signal sequence and pauses translation
  - Second, binds to SRP receptor in ER membrane, docking the ribosome over a channel, only to have SRP released and let translation continue
- The growing polypeptide is threaded through the channel to cross the ER membrane, but if it isn't a membrane protein, it is released into the lumen of the ER
- Most times, the ER signal sequence is removed by **signal peptidase**
- Some proteins are meant to function in the ER, and they have retention signals with the ER signal sequence
- Or they are going to the Golgi, lysosomes, vacuoles, plasma membrane, or secretion to leave the ER to go to their right location
  - This happens in vesicles formed from one compartment then moves through the cytosol to fuse with another
  - Vesicles may go to the Golgi, and the Golgi vesicles may go to lysosomes, vacuoles, or plasma membrane
  - It is the Sorting signal in the amino acid sequences directing all proteins to their right location

# Proteins Are Sorted Post-Translationally to the Nucleus, Peroxisomes, Mitochondria, and Chloroplasts
- The Nucleus, proxisomes, mitochondira, and chloroplasts all need proteins from the cytosol
- For the protein to go to the right organelle, it needs an appropriate sorting signal as a part of the amino acid sequence
- For our example, we will see how a protein goes to the mitochondrial matrix
  - A short amino acid sequence in the protein at the N-terminus is th ematrix-targeting sequence, and importing this protein needs intricate protein-protein interactions
  - A protein for the mitochondrial matrix is made in the cytosol, then **chaperones** keep it unfoled
  - A receptor protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane recognizes the matrix-targeting sequence
  - The protein is released from the chaperone, then sent to a channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  - In this unfolded state, mitochondrial proteins can be threaded through a channel, and another in the inner mitochondrial membrane
  - These channels are close at the contact sites of outer and inner membranes, so as the protein emerges the matrix, the chaperone proteins are already ready to keep the protein unfolded
  - Soon the matrix-targeting sequence is cleaved and the entire protein is threaded into the matrix, so soon the chaperone proteins are released and folds into a 3d structure
