- The term Nucleus has a different meaning in cell biology
- It is an organelle found in eukaryotic celsl containing most of the cell's genetic material
	- Small amounts are also outside of the nucleus, in the mitochondria and chloroplasts
- The membranes that enclose the nucleus are part of a larger network of membranes called the endomembrane system.
	- This system got the Nuclear envelope (which encloses the nucleus), but also the:
		- Endoplasmic Reticulum
		- Golgi Apparatus
		- Lysosomes
		- Vacuoles
		- Peroxisomes
	- Endo- (meaning inside) originally referred only to these organelles and internal membranes. But we now know that the plasma membrane is also part of this integrated membrane system
	- This section will cover the nucleus and the structures and functions of the organelles and membranes of the endomembrane system.
- # The Eukaryotic Nucleus Contains Chromosomes
	- ## The Nucleus is enclosed by the nuclear envelope, housing genetic material
		- Nuclear pores in the double-membrane are formed where inner and outer nuclear membranes make contact with each other
		- The pores provide a passageway for molecules and macromolecules in and out of the nucleus
		- Cell biologists view the nuclear envelope as part of the endomembrane system, the materials within the nucleus are not
	- ## Inside are chromosomes and a filamentous protein network called the nuclear matrix
		- Each Chromosome is composed of genetic material, namely DNA and proteins that compact it
			- The complex is referred to as **chromatin**
		- The **nuclear matrix** consists of the **nuclear lamina**, which composed of intermediate filaments that line the inner nuclear membrane, and an internal nuclear matrix, connected to the lamina and fills the interior of the nucleus.
		- The nuclear matrix serves to organize the chromosomes within th nucleus.
		- Each chromosome is located in a distinct **Chromosome Territory**
			- It is visible when cells are exposed to dyes that label specific types of chromosomes
		- The primary functions of the nucleus are the protection, organization, replication, and expression of genetic material

			- Also assembles ribosomal subunits, structures involved in producing polypeptides during translation
			- The assembly of ribosomal subunits occur in the nucleolus
				- droplet organelle in the nucleus of nondividing cells
		- A **ribosome** is composed of two subunits:
			- One small and one large.
			- Each subunit contains 1+ RNA molecules and several types of proteins
			- Most RNA molecules that are components of ribosomes are made in vicinity of the nucleolus
			- By comparison,ribosomes made in the cytosol must go through the nucleus via pores
		- The ribosomal proteins and RNA molecules then enter the nucleolus and are assembled into ribosomal subunits.
		- Finally, the subunit exits the nucleolus and moves through the nuclear mores into the cytosol, letting it carry out polypeptide synthesis
- # The Endoplasmic Reticulum Initiates the Sorting of Some Proteins and Carries Out Metabolic Functions
	- ## The ER is a network of membranes of flattened, fluid filled tubules called cisternae
		- Endoplasmic Reticulum refers to the location and shape of the organelle
			- Endoplasmic (Greek, for in the cytoplasm)
			- Reticulum (Latin, for little net)
		- **Lumen** refers to the internal space of an organelle
			- The ER membrane encloses a compartment called the ER lumen.
		- There are two types of ER: rough ER, and smooth ER
	- ## Rough ER
