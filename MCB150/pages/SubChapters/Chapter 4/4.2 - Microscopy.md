- The microscope magnifies images to let researchers see the structure and inner workings of a cell.
- A micrograph is an image taken with the help of a microscope
- The first one was made in 1595 by Zacharias Jansen of Holland
- 1665 Robert Hooke studied cork under a primitive microscope and saw the cell walls, remembered latin cellula, then made the word cell
- Three important parts for microscopy:
	- Resolution, the measure of clarity of an image. Can you tell two adjacent abjects as distinct? 
	- Contrast: Relative differences in lightness darkness, or color between adjacent regions in a sample. 
		- Stains help with this as it increases contrast.
		- Colorization is artifical coloring to emphasize structures.
	- Magnification: The ratio between the size of an image made by the microscope to the actual object size. 
		- Each microscope has a range of magnification before objects appear too blurry to be readily observed
- Two categories exist: Light microscopes using light and electron microscopes using beams of electrons for illumination
	- Good light microscopes can go to 0.2 micron
- Resolution is improved when illumination source has a shorter wavelength. This is why in 1931, Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska's invention of the electron microscope was so big. Wavelength of an electron microscope is far better and the resolution is usually 2 nanometers (100 times better)

- We have had major advancements. Improvements in lens, microscope organization, sample preparation, sample illumination, and computerized image processing created many light microscopes each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
	- Examples of improvements:

- Similarly, improvements in electron microscopy occurred during the 30s, 40s, and the 50s with huge advances to our ability to understand cell structure.
	- We got two types now, Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
		- TEM is a beam of electrons transmitting through a biological samply.
		- It is stained with a heavy metal first. Then stuck to copper grid and placed in a TEM
		- When electrons strike the sample, some hit the metal and scatter, and those who pass through are focused to form an image on a photographic plate or screen
		- Metal-stained regions of the sample that scatter electrons appear as darker areas as there is less electron penetration
		- However, these Microscopes are expensive and cannot be used on living cells
		- Scanning electron microscopy is used to view the surface.
		- Coat with heavy metal, exposed to electron beam that scans its surface, and the secondary electrons are emitted from the sample, being detected and creates an image of its 3d surface.
