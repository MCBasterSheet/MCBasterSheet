> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Compare and Contrast 3 forms of gene transfer, Conjugation, transformation, and transduction, in bacteria
> 2. Analyze Lederberg and Tatum results and how they found conjugation (YOU BITCHES CAME BACK AGAIN FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU)
> 3. Describe the process of horizontal Gene transfer

- Bacteria has a shit laod of genetic diversity despite asexual reproduction
- Strain is a lineasge with genetic differences compared to another, and some can be resistant to antibiotics whilst others are not
- But how does it come?
  - First, mutations occur that can alter the genome and affect traits
  - Second, diversity comes from gene transfer, where genetic material is transferred from one bacterial cell to another, and this gene transfer let one bacterium spread to other strains
- Three ways can happen:
  - Conjugation is the direct physical interaction between two bacterial cells, and during conjugation, one bacterium acts as a Donor and transfers the DNA
  - Transformation is the process where DNA is released into the environment and taken by another bacterial cell
  - Transduction is when bacteriophages infect a bac terial cell and transfers some of the cell's DNA to another one

# Feature Investiation: Lederberg and Tatum's Work on *E. coli* Demonstrated Gene Tarnsfer Between Bacteria and Led to the Discovery of Conjugation
- These two did experiments and found gene transfer among bacteria, using E. coli with different nutritional requirements for growth
- Strains needing methionine and biotin and not needing threonine and proline and strains not needing methionine and biotin and needing threonine and proline were mixed
- They found that mixing them together made 10 bacterial colonies. Striking
- Only conclusion they were able to make is that mixture occurred, but unknown as to which direction is happened
- Davis came in then and did the same thing with a U tube, only letting DNA pass through, and found no growth so we need physical contact

# During Conjugation, DNA is Transferred from a Donor Cell to a Recipient Cell
- Lederbergs and Hayes and Cavalli-Sforza found only some strains can give genetic material during conjugation
  - E.g. only 5% of E. coli actual act as donor strains
  - Though you can just be mixed with a donor strain and then boom, you win
  - Hayes correctlyu proposed the ned for a fertility factor (F factor)
- Donors had regions identified to transfer portions of bacterial chromosomes at high frequencies, named the *Hfr*, High Frequencyh for recombination
- Below shows how the transfer works, with one cell being the F factor carrier and the other one not being so

- The second half of that image shows the events during conjugation of E. coli
- Sex pili (pilus is singular) are made by F+ cells binding to F- cells
- They are named so as it is called bacterial mating here (but no actual equal genetic contribution and no offspring
- Donor strains have genes responsible for the formation of sex pili, where F+ strains located on the F factor and the F+ cells make very long pili for F- cells
  - Contact makes the pili shorten, drawing the donor and receipient cells closer together
  - Shortening of the pili lets contact between the donor and recipient initate
- First, a bridge happens to do DNA transfer
  - One strand of the F factor DNA is cut at the origin of transfer and travels the conjugation bridge into the recipient cell
  - Other strand remains in the donor cell, and ocmplementary strand is synthesized, restoring the F factor DNA to its original double-stranded condition
