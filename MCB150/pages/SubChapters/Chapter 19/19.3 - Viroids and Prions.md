> 1. Distinguish between a viroid and virus
> 2. Describe the structure of prions and explain how they cause disease

> Some nonliving infectious agents are even more simpler than viruses. Viroids, made of only RNA, and prions, only made of protiens

# Viroids are RNA molecules Infecting Plant Cells
- 1971 Diener found an agent of potato spindle tuber disease is a small RNA molecule with no protein
- **viroid**, he coined the name is a single-stranded cirucular RNA molecule a few hundred nucleotides in length
- Infecting plant cells, viroids depend entirely on host enzymes for their replication
  - Some do it in the nucleus, some in the chloroplast
  - RNA genomes of viroids do not code for any proteins, so how do they affect plant cells?
  - Viroid RNA has ribozyme activity, and researchers hypothesized that this activity may damage plants by interfering with the function of the host cell molecules
  - The mechanism it works is still not well understood
- Since Diener, many more viroids have been found affecting many economically important plants
  - They have devestating effects, killing 20 million coconut trees in SEA and New Guinea
  - Sometimes though they do smaller damage, just minor cracks, necrosis, stem shortening, delay sin foliation, flowering, and fruit ripening
