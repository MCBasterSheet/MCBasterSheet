> Some nonliving infectious agents are even more simpler than viruses. Viroids, made of only RNA, and prions, only made of protiens

# Viroids are RNA molecules Infecting Plant Cells
- 1971 Diener found an agent of potato spindle tuber disease is a small RNA molecule with no protein
- **viroid**, he coined the name is a single-stranded cirucular RNA molecule a few hundred nucleotides in length
- Infecting plant cells, viroids depend entirely on host enzymes for their replication
  - Some do it in the nucleus, some in the chloroplast
  - RNA genomes of viroids do not code for any proteins, so how do they affect plant cells?
  - Viroid RNA has ribozyme activity, and researchers hypothesized that this activity may damage plants by interfering with the function of the host cell molecules
  - The mechanism it works is still not well understood
- Since Diener, many more viroids have been found affecting many economically important plants
  - They have devestating effects, killing 20 million coconut trees in SEA and New Guinea
  - Sometimes though they do smaller damage, just minor cracks, necrosis, stem shortening, delay sin foliation, flowering, and fruit ripening

# Prions Are Infectious Proteins Causing Neurodegenerative Diseases
- 1980s scientists found something without genetic material fucking things up
- 60s Alper and Griffith found animals with certain neuodegenerative diseases remained infectous after radiation that would destroy any DNA and RNA, and the infectious agent was a protein
- Pruisner, 1970s, was so terrified by a death of a patient from such a disease and found that this protein, this **prion** caused the destruction of his patient.
  - He found a particle as a proteinaceous infectous agent, winning him the noble prize in physiology or medicine for his work in 1997
- Prion Diseases arise from the ability of the prion to induce abnormal folding in normal protein molecules
  - They exist in a disease-causing conformation designated PrP<sup/>C</sup>, with C standing for Cellular
  - The normal protein encoded by an individual's genome, andis expressed at low levels in certain types of neurons

- **How does one get prion disease?**
  - Eating an animal with the disease
  - Prion goes through stomach and small intestine and goes into the bloodstream
  - After being taken by neurons, the prions convert normal proteins into abnormal ones
- As a prion progresses, the PrP<sup/>Sc</sup> proteins are deposited as dense aggregates that form tough fibrils in the cells of the brain and peripheral nervous tissues, causing disease symptoms
  - Some proteins are also secreted from infected cells, traveling through the bloodstream
  - This way, prion disease spreads through the body like many viral diseases
- Prions attack humans, livestock, and wildlife 
  - Prion diseases are termed **transmissible spongiform encephalopathies** (TSEs)
  - With how much brain tissue is destroyed from the disease, the brain has a spongy appearance

- Most prion diseases progress fairly slowly
  - Over a few years, symptoms proceed from a loss of motor control to dementia, paralysis, wasting, then death
  - More prions, more symptoms
  - No treatments exist
