> Many bacteria are unicellular, but some are pairs, chains, or clumps. Bacteria are also widespread on Earth, and numerous species cause disease. Here, we ssee the structure and replication of the bacteria genome and the organization of DNA sequences along a bacterial chromosome, seeing how it is compacted and transmitted asexually

# Bacteria Typically Have Circular Chromosomes That Carry a Few Thousand Genes
- Genes of bacteria are within structures known as bacterial chromosomes
  - Bacteria usually one a single type of chromosome, but can have more than one copy, dependent on bacterial species and growth conditions (usually 1-4 identical chromosomes)
  - Each one is tightly packed within a distincct **nucleoid** of the cell, and unlike eukaryotes, the bacterial nucleoid is not a separate cellular compartment with a membrane, rather it is in direct contact with the cytoplasm
  - Bacterial chromosomes contain molecules of double-stranded DNA with many other proteins, usually cirular, with a few million base pairs long
  - Bacterial chromosomes contain a few thousand genes throughout the chromosome, and gene sequences that encode proteins account for the largest part of bacterial DNA
  - Other nucleotide sequences play a role in DNA replciation, gene expression, and chromosome structure, one being the **origin of replication**, a few hundred base pairs long and the site of assembly of several proteins required for DNA replication

# The Formation of Chromosomal Loops and DNA Supercoiling Make the Bacterial Chromosome Compact
- Bacteria is much smaller, and DNA must be folded 1000 times smaller
- This happens via loop domains and DNa supercoiling

- No histones, but instead proteins make **loop domains**, chromosomal segments folded into loops
- Show above, DNA-binding proteins anchor bases of the loops in place, loops differing on size and species of bacteria
  - E. Coli has a few hundred loops
  - **Looping compacts it by 10 fold**
  - This is kinda like waht chromatin did in Chapter 11 (fuck you I'm not giving you a link back there)
- **Supercoiling** is the second important step, and since DNA is long and thin, twisting can change conformation like twisting a rubberband
  - As DNA is already coiled, to coil more is super coiling
  - Topoimerases twist the DNa and control the degree of DNA supercoiling

# Plasmids Are Small, Circular Pieces of Extrachromosomal DNA
- Bacterial cells also have plasmids, small circular pieces separate from bacterial chromosomes
- Plasmids are in bacteria and some eukaryotic cells, like yeast
- Some are just a few thousand base pairs and carry a gene or two, and some a 100k-500k bp long and carry dozens to hundreds of genes
- A plasmid has its own ori, letting it be replicated independently of the bacterial chromosome
  - The DNA sequence of the ori influences how many copies of the plasmid is found in the cell
  - Strong origins are very strong due to many copies being made, 100 per cell even
  - Others are low, being 1-2 per cell

- Why Plasmids?
  - They can give help in certain conditions, and here is a list of them
    1. Resistance plasmid, R factors, contain genes giving resistance to antibiotics or other types of toxins
    2. Degradative plasmids carry genes to enable bacterium to digest and utilize wacky shit like toluene, and organic solvent
    3. Virulence plasmid have genes to make bacteriums pathogenic
    4. Fertility plasmids, F factors, let bacteria transfer genes to each other, described later in the chapter
- Sometimes, plasmids just enter the chromosome, and those who have the option to stay in or out are called **episomes**

# Most Bacteria Reproduce by Binary Fission
- Bacteria divide nearly every 20-30 minutes, able to form a colony of identical copies of 10-100 million cells in less than a day

- **binary fission** is cell division for bacteria, and it starts with a single chromosome
  - Before division, the cell replicates its DNA
  - Then the plasma membrane draws inwards, make a new cell-wall materia to separate the two daughter cells, each one receiving copies of the original chromosome
  - Now we have 2 clones

- Binary fission usualyl needs FtsA and FtsZ, evolutionarily related to actin and tubulin (YEAH THE FUCKING [CHAPTER 4](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/pages/SubChapters/Chapter%204/4.4%20-%20The%20Cytosol.md) STUFF)
- FtsA helps filaments of FtsZ assemble into structures called a Z-ring at the site where a septum iwll be formed to separate the daughter cells
- The Septum formation procedure is not well understood, and it is though ti attracts binding of proteins needed to divide
  - E.g. attract enzymes to synthesize peptidoglycan that gets smaller and smaller, dividing the cell into 2 daughter cells
- Some archaea also use the Fts proteins, but under different mechanisms
- Plasmids replicate independently of bacterial chromosome, where during binary fission, the plasmids are distributed to the daughter cells so each one receives 1+ copies of each plasmid
