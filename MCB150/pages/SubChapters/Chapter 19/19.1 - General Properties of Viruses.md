> # Learning Goal: Compare and contrast types of viruses regarding host range, structure and genomes

- Viruses are not living, not made by cells not by themselves, don't metabolize, has no homeostasis, or even reproduce
  - It needs a living host to do all of these things
- The first virus discovered was the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
  - It damages leaves, flowers, and fruit but never kills
  - Adolf Mayer found it can be transferred via sap
  - Dmitri Ivanovski shown it wasn't a bacterium via filtering
  - Animal viruses also popped up and soon
  - 1900 Yellow fever, the first human virus was identified
- Since then, microbiologists, geneticists, and molecular biologists found great interest in sturcture, genetic composition, and replication of viruses

# Viruses Are Remarkably Varied, Despite Their Simple Structure
- Viruses are a small infectious particle consisting of nucleic acids in a protein coating
  - Each virus is different in characteristics, in host, structure, and genome composition

## *Differences in Host Range*
- A cell infected is called a **host cell** and a species can be infected by a specific virus called a host species for the virus
- Some can do a lot, TMV was able to infect over 150 types of plants
- Still, despite their specificity, we got a shit load of human diseases

## *Structural Differences*
- Can't be seen with light microscopes and were only ever seen with electron microscopes
  - Ranging from 20-400nm in size (bacteria being 1000nm and eukaryotes being another 10-1000x that)
- Common features of a viruses include
  - Capsid, enclosing a genome of 1+ molecules of Nucleic Acid
  - Helical and polyhedral capsids exist
  - Many that infect animal cells also have a viral envelope enclosing it, having a lipid bilayer derived from the plasma membrane of the host cell embedded with a lot of virally encoded glycoproteins

- The Capsid and Envelope also let virsues infect their hosts
  - Many viruses have protein fibers with a knob or spike glycoproteins to bind to the surface
  - Bacteriophages have more complex protein coat with accessory structure to anchor the virus to the host cell and transfer the viral nucleic acid into the bacterial cytoplasm
  - The tail of bacteriophages also attach the virus to the bacterial cell wall
 
## *Genome Differences*
- The genetic material in a virus is called a **viral genome**
- The composition also varies differently among different types of viruses, with some of the nucleic acids being in DNA, whilst others being in the form of RNA
  - These are called DNA and RNA viruses respectively
  - Some viruses use RNA for the genome whilst all living organisms use DNA, but why? In fact, sometimes viruses just have a single stranded genome for lol reasons
  - Most genomes can also be linear or circular, and some viruses have more than one copy
- These genomes also differ in size, from a few thousand to hundred thousand nucleotides in length
