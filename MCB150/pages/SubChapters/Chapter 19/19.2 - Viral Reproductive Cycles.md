> The expression of viral genes leads to a series of steps, a **viral reproductive cycle** which creates new viruses. The details differ among various types of viruses, and a virus can have several alternative cycles. Either way, nearly all viruses have 5-6 common steps, paying particular attention to HIV this section which causes AIDS

# Viral Reproductive Cycle Consists of a Few Common Steps
- Below show sthe steps for two different types of viruses
  - (A) is shows the cycle of a phage λ, a bacteriophage with double-stranded DNA as its genome
  - (B) depicts HIV, an enveloped animal virus containing single-stranded RNA
  - Flavor text depicts the reproductive cycle of the two very different viruses

## *Step 1: Attachment*
- The virus attaches to the surface of the host cell
- It is super specific as protein in the virus recognize and bind to specific molecules on the cell surface
- Phage λ has the tail fibers bind to proteins on the outer bacterial cell membrane of E. coli
- HIV has spike glycoproteins in the viral envelope bind to protein receptors in the plasma membrane of human white blood cells called helped T cells

 ## *Step 2: Entry*
 - After attachment, the viral genome enters the host cell
 - Attachment of the phage λ stimulates conformation change in the coat proteins, so the shaft contracts and the phage injects DNA into the bacterial cytoplasm
 - The envelope of HIV however just fuses into the host cell so both the capsid and contents are released into the cytosol
   - Some capsid proteins are then removed by host cell enzymes, a process called uncoating
   - For HIV, this releases 2 copies of the viral RNA and molecules of two enzymes called reverse transcriptase and integrase into the cytosol, needed for Integration
 - The entrance of a viral genome leads to one or few viral genes being expressed immediately due to host cell enzymes and ribosomes
   - Expression of genes leads to step 3/4 of the reproductive cycle, depending on the virus
   - Some genoemes, like λ and HIV, can also integrate into the chromosome of a cell letting it either go to step 3 (delaying the production), or to step 4 and instandly lead to production of new viruses

## *Step 3: Integration*
- Viruses capable of integration carry a gene encoding an enzymes called integrase, cutting the host's chromosomal DNA and inserting the viral genome into the chromosome
- λ has the double-stranded DNA enter the cell be directly integrated onto the double stranded DNA of a chromosome
  - Integration creates a prophage, and when a bacterial cell divides, the prophage is copied and transmitted to daughter cells along with the bacterial chromosomal DNA
- The phase of a viral reproductive cycle when a prophage is integrated into a bacterial chromosome is caleld the lysogenic cycle
  - New phages aren't made here, and the host cell is not destroyed
  - Sometimes a prophage can be excised from teh bacterial chromosome to end the lysogenic cycle, an excised prophage ccan also proceed to the lytic cycle
- How does RNA integrate?
  - The genome must be compied into the DNA, and HIV does this via **reverse transcriptase**, carried over within the capsid and released into the host cell along with viral RNA
  - This reverse Transcriptase uses viral RNA to make a complementary copy of DNA
  - The complementary DNA is used to make a template for double-stranded viral DNA
  - This is reverse transcription as it makes DNA from RNA instead
  - The double-stranded DNA enters the nucleus and is inserted into a host chromosome via integrase (also carried into the capsid)
  - Integration leads to the viral DNA in a eukaryotic cell being called a **provirus**
- Viruses like HIV in function are called **Retroviruses**

## *Step 4: Synthesis of Viral Components*
- The production of new viruses in the host cell invovles the replication of the viral genome and the synthesis of viral proteins that make up the protein coat
  - Phages must be excised in step 3 before synthesis of new viral components can occur, needing excisionase to do this
  - Following excision, host cell enzymes make many copes of the phage DNA and transcribe the genes within these copies into mRNA
  - Lastly, the host cell ribosome translate this viral mRNA into viral proteins and expression of phage genes also degrades the host chromosomal DNA
- In the case of HIV, provirus DNA is not excised from the host chromosome
  - Instead, it engages in transcription to produce many copies of viral RNA, so when viral RNA enters the cytosol, they make viral proteins and serve as the genomes for new viral particles

## *Step 5: Viral Assembly*
- After all of the necessary components have been synthesized, they must be assembled into new viruses
  - Some self-assemble, spontaneous binding to complete a viral particle
  - Others don't self assemble, λ needing the hlelp of noncapsid proteins not found in completed phage particle
    - Either they need noncapsid proteins as enzymes modifying capsid proteins or some as scaffolding for assembly of the capsid
  - Assembly of HIV needs two stages
    - First, capsid proteins assemble around 2 molecules of viral RNA and molecules of reverse transcriptase and integrase
    - Next, the newly form capsid gets the out envelope in the form of budding, and then it proceeds to step 6, RELEASE
## *Step 6: Release*
- The last step of viral reproductive cycle is the release of new viruses from the host cell
- Release of bascteriophages is dramatic
  - The rigid cell wall forces the phages to lyse their host cell to escape
  - After phages have been assembled, phage-encoded enzymes called lysozymes digest the bacterial cell wall
  - Lysis releases many new phages into the environment, letting them infect other bacteria and begin the cycle again
  - 1,2,4,5, and 6 are the lytic cycle as it leads to cell lysis
- Release of enveloped viruses are less dramatic
  - The virus escapes via budding that does not lyse the cell
  - HIV, a newly assembled virus particle associates with a portion of the plasma membrane containing HIV spike glycoprotiens
  - The membrane enfolds the viral capsid and buds from the surface of teh cell
  - This is how all viruses acquire their envelope, a piece of host cell membrane studded with viral glycoproteins

## *Latency in Bacteriophages*
- Viruses can integrate their genomes into a host chromosome, and most cases the prophages or provirus may remain inactive, or latent for a long time
- Most viral genes are silent during latency, and viral reproductive cycle does not progress to stage 4
- Latency is also called lysogeny
  - Both prophage and host cell are said to be lyosgenic, so a lysogenic bacterium prepares to divide, copying the prophage DNA with its own DNA, so each daughter cell inherits a copy of the prophage
  - A prophage can be replicated repeatedly in this way without killing the host cell or producing new phage particles
  - This is the lysogenic cycle
- Bacteriophages following either lysogenic or lytic cycles are called **temperate phages**
  - λ is a temperate phage
  - Infection, it enters the lysogenic cycle or proceeds directly to the lytic cycle
  - Other phages, **virulent phages**, only have lytic cycles
  - The genome of the virulent phage is not capable of integrating into a host chormosome
  - Phage T4 is a virulent phage infecting E. coli
  - Unlike λ, which can coexist harmlessly in E. coli, T4 always lyses the host cell

- Temperate phages like λ has environmental conditions influence whether or not viral DNA is integrated into a host chromosome and how long the virus remains in the lysogenic cycle
  - With nutrients, phage λ proceeds to the lytic cycle after DNA enters the cell
  - If nutrients are in short supply, lysogenic cycle iis favored because there may be not enough materials to make new viruses
  - Then when nutrients come back, lytic cycle initiates

## *Latency in Human Viruses*
- HIV has latency occur because the virus integration into the genome may be dormant for a long time
- The genome of some other viruses exist as an episome, genetic element replicating independently of the chromosomal DNA, but also can occaisionally integrate into chromosomal DNA
- Viral Genomes exist as episomes include different types of herpesviruses causing cold sores, genital herpes, and chickenpox
  - Infection with herpes leads to periodic outbreaks of disease symptoms when the virus switches from the latent, spisomal form to the active form that produces new virus particles
- Let's consider varicella-zoster
  - Initially, you have chickenpox and that reemains latent for many years
  - Then shingles come when it turns on again

# Emerging Viruses May Spread Rapidly Through a Population
- Emerging Viruses are those recently arisen with great probability to cause infection, typically caused by mutations in pre-existing viruses
- It kills many

## *Coronavirus*
- Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory infection called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
- Came from bats, and is an enveloped virus with an RNA genome, named from its club-shaped viral spike protiens that make a corona shape

- Straight from Wuhan, in only a few months, COVID-19 began spreading from Human-to-human across the world as a **pandemic**, a huge geographical affected area of COVID

## *Influenza Virus*
- New Strains of flu comes regularly due to mutations, like H1N1 which came from swine flu

## *Zika Virus*
- Enveloped with a genome of a single-stranded RNA, it comes from the Zika Forests of Uganda
- From mosquitos, it causes mild symptoms but it can also cause Guillain-Barre syndrome and cause brain abnormalities in fetuses

## *HIV*
- STD. Closely related to Simian Immunodeficiency Virus
- Targets helper T cells (THE KILL YOURSELF CELL)
- It destroys T cells and causes the immune system to be seriously compromised, and the individual is suceptible to infectious diseases caused opportunistic infections that normally does not threaten healthy people
- An insidious feature is reverse transcriptase, which copies RNA genome into DNA, lacks a proofreading function so mutations come a lot and undermines one's ability to fight HIV

# Drugs Have Been Developed to Combat the Proliferation of HIV
- No drug can eliminate viruses from one's body
- One appraoch to the design of antiviral treatments is to develop drugs meant to bind proteins encoded by the viral genome
  - Azidothymidine mimics the structure of a normal nucleotide and binds to the enzyme reverase transcriptase
- Another way to to inhibit proteases, enzymes that assemble HIV
  - Non-functional proteases can't cut capsid proteins, making them smaller and able to assemble into a capsid structure
  - If proteases do not function, the capsid will not assemble and no new HIV particles will be made
- A major challenge is just finding drugs inhibiting viral proteins without binding to host cells and inhibiting normal cellular functions
- Also avoiding drugs that doesn't have mutant resistant strains due to HIV's mutative properties
- They just make drug cocktails now

# Origin of Viruses?
- No fossil record exists, so researchers must rely on analysis of modern viruses to develop hypothesis about their origins
- Viral genomes follow the same rules of gene expression as genomes on their host cells, needing promoters and nucleic acids
- No known virus makes its own ribosomes or generates energy to make new viruses, so could it come after cells?

## *Progressive Evolution from Genetic Elements Within Cells*
- Coming from macromolecules, the precursors of the first viruses may have been RNA molecules or plasmids (small ciruclar DNA independent of chromosomes)
- Biologists hypothesize that such RNA or DNA moelcules may become more complex by acquiring gnees coding for proteins that facilitate their own replication

## *Regressive Evolution from Cells
- They could just reduce traits ove time
- Viruses are degenerate cells retained the minimal genetic information for reproduction, so some viruses may have originated as small cells infecting larger cells that lost genes for independent existence

## *Parallel Evolution within Cells*
- Maybe they were in the  primordial soup, and with DNA genomes likely being precursors of RNA, the RNA world likely has let both viruses and cellular organisms be made
