> # Learning Goals:
> 1. List the steps in viral reproductive cycles, distinguishing between lysogenic and lytic cycles
> 2. Describe how emerging viruses, like COVID-19 and HIV, arise and spread throughout the population
> 3. Explain how an understanding of viral sturctures and reproduction can aid in the development of drugs to combat viruses
> 4. Outline three hypotheses regarding origin of viruses
>
> The expression of viral genes leads to a series of steps, a **viral reproductive cycle** which creates new viruses. The details differ among various types of viruses, and a virus can have several alternative cycles. Either way, nearly all viruses have 5-6 common steps, paying particular attention to HIV this section which causes AIDS

# Viral Reproductive Cycle Consists of a Few Common Steps
- Below show sthe steps for two different types of viruses
  - (A) is shows the cycle of a phage λ, a bacteriophage with double-stranded DNA as its genome
  - (B) depicts HIV, an enveloped animal virus containing single-stranded RNA
  - Flavor text depicts the reproductive cycle of the two very different viruses

## *Step 1: Attachment*
- The virus attaches to the surface of the host cell
- It is super specific as protein in the virus recognize and bind to specific molecules on the cell surface
- Phage λ has the tail fibers bind to proteins on the outer bacterial cell membrane of E. coli
- HIV has spike glycoproteins in the viral envelope bind to protein receptors in the plasma membrane of human white blood cells called helped T cells
