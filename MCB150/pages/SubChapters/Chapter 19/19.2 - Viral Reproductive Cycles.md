> The expression of viral genes leads to a series of steps, a **viral reproductive cycle** which creates new viruses. The details differ among various types of viruses, and a virus can have several alternative cycles. Either way, nearly all viruses have 5-6 common steps, paying particular attention to HIV this section which causes AIDS

# Viral Reproductive Cycle Consists of a Few Common Steps
- Below show sthe steps for two different types of viruses
  - (A) is shows the cycle of a phage λ, a bacteriophage with double-stranded DNA as its genome
  - (B) depicts HIV, an enveloped animal virus containing single-stranded RNA
  - Flavor text depicts the reproductive cycle of the two very different viruses

## *Step 1: Attachment*
- The virus attaches to the surface of the host cell
- It is super specific as protein in the virus recognize and bind to specific molecules on the cell surface
- Phage λ has the tail fibers bind to proteins on the outer bacterial cell membrane of E. coli
- HIV has spike glycoproteins in the viral envelope bind to protein receptors in the plasma membrane of human white blood cells called helped T cells

 ## *Step 2: Entry*
 - After attachment, the viral genome enters the host cell
 - Attachment of the phage λ stimulates conformation change in the coat proteins, so the shaft contracts and the phage injects DNA into the bacterial cytoplasm
 - The envelope of HIV however just fuses into the host cell so both the capsid and contents are released into the cytosol
   - Some capsid proteins are then removed by host cell enzymes, a process called uncoating
   - For HIV, this releases 2 copies of the viral RNA and molecules of two enzymes called reverse transcriptase and integrase into the cytosol, needed for Integration
 - The entrance of a viral genome leads to one or few viral genes being expressed immediately due to host cell enzymes and ribosomes
   - Expression of genes leads to step 3/4 of the reproductive cycle, depending on the virus
   - Some genoemes, like λ and HIV, can also integrate into the chromosome of a cell letting it either go to step 3 (delaying the production), or to step 4 and instandly lead to production of new viruses

## *Step 3: Integration*
- Viruses capable of integration carry a gene encoding an enzymes called integrase, cutting the host's chromosomal DNA and inserting the viral genome into the chromosome
- λ has the double-stranded DNA enter the cell be directly integrated onto the double stranded DNA of a chromosome
  - Integration creates a prophage, and when a bacterial cell divides, the prophage is copied and transmitted to daughter cells along with the bacterial chromosomal DNA
- The phase of a viral reproductive cycle when a prophage is integrated into a bacterial chromosome is caleld the lysogenic cycle
  - New phages aren't made here, and the host cell is not destroyed
  - Sometimes a prophage can be excised from teh bacterial chromosome to end the lysogenic cycle, an excised prophage ccan also proceed to the lytic cycle
- How does RNA integrate?
  - The genome must be compied into the DNA, and HIV does this via **reverse transcriptase**, carried over within the capsid and released into the host cell along with viral RNA
  - This reverse Transcriptase uses viral RNA to make a complementary copy of DNA
  - The complementary DNA is used to make a template for double-stranded viral DNA
  - This is reverse transcription as it makes DNA from RNA instead
  - The double-stranded DNA enters the nucleus and is inserted into a host chromosome via integrase (also carried into the capsid)
  - Integration leads to the viral DNA in a eukaryotic cell being called a **provirus**
- Viruses like HIV in function are called **Retroviruses**

## *Step 4: Synthesis of Viral Components*
- The production of new viruses in the host cell invovles the replication of the viral genome and the synthesis of viral proteins that make up the protein coat
  - Phages must be excised in step 3 before synthesis of new viral components can occur, needing excisionase to do this
  - Following excision, host cell enzymes make many copes of the phage DNA and transcribe the genes within these copies into mRNA
  - Lastly, the host cell ribosome translate this viral mRNA into viral proteins and expression of phage genes also degrades the host chromosomal DNA
- In the case of HIV, provirus DNA is not excised from the host chromosome
  - Instead, it engages in transcription to produce many copies of viral RNA, so when viral RNA enters the cytosol, they make viral proteins and serve as the genomes for new viral particles

## *Step 5: Viral Assembly*
- After all of the necessary components have been synthesized, they must be assembled into new viruses
  - Some self-assemble, spontaneous binding to complete a viral particle
  - Others don't self assemble, λ needing the hlelp of noncapsid proteins not found in completed phage particle
    - Either they need noncapsid proteins as enzymes modifying capsid proteins or some as scaffolding for assembly of the capsid
  - Assembly of HIV needs two stages
    - First, capsid proteins assemble around 2 molecules of viral RNA and molecules of reverse transcriptase and integrase
    - Next, the newly form capsid gets the out envelope in the form of budding, and then it proceeds to step 6, RELEASE
## *Step 6: Release*
- The last step of viral reproductive cycle is the release of new viruses from the host cell
- Release of bascteriophages is dramatic
  - The rigid cell wall forces the phages to lyse their host cell to escape
  - After phages have been assembled, phage-encoded enzymes called lysozymes digest the bacterial cell wall
  - Lysis releases many new phages into the environment, letting them infect other bacteria and begin the cycle again
  - 1,2,4,5, and 6 are the lytic cycle as it leads to cell lysis
- Release of enveloped viruses are less dramatic
  - The virus escapes via budding that does not lyse the cell
  - HIV, a newly assembled virus particle associates with a portion of the plasma membrane containing HIV spike glycoprotiens
  - The membrane enfolds the viral capsid and buds from the surface of teh cell
  - This is how all viruses acquire their envelope, a piece of host cell membrane studded with viral glycoproteins
