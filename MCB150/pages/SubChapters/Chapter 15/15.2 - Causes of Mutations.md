> ## *Feature Investigation: Lederbergs using replica plating to show mutations are random events*
> - Early on, we ask, are mutations from pre-existing circumstances or random events happening to a gene of any individual?
> - 19th century FRENCH Jean-Baptiste Lamarck suggested that physiological events (use/disuse) determines if some traits are passed on
>   - If you jump a lot, your kid will jump a lot too
> - Others say this is random so if you got a good mutation you just survive more lol
> - 1940s-1950s Joshua and Esther Lederberg focused on mutations in bacteria to test this shit
>     1. Make a lot of E. Coli, get a master plate of original E. coli
>     2. Use **replica plating**, where sterile cloth is tapped onto the master plate, transferred to two secondary plates with bacterial growth agents for a specific mutation

> - Above, the secondary plates had T1 Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bateria and cause them to lyse
>   - Only bacteria able to grow are the ones mutated enough to resist T1; they are termed *ton<sup/>r</sup>*
>   - Suprisingly, they occupied the same locations on each plate and since all others were murdered by bacteriophages, they found that these *ton<sup/>r</sup>* mutations occurred randomly while bacterial cells were forming colonies on the nonselective master plate
>     - Being in the presence of T1 Bacteriophages did not mean the mutations are bound to develop, rather they just selected for the growth of the *ton<sup/>r</sup>* mutants that already existed

> # Learning Goals
> 1. Analyze the replica plating experiments of the Leerbergs
> 2. Describe the difference between spontaneous and induced mutations
> 3. Define mutagen, and distinguish between chemical and physical mutagens
> 4. Analyze the results of an Ames test for determining if a substance is a mutagen
>
> - As we see, mutations affect gene expression in a variety of ways, and their timing have important consequences
> - Here is the part that sucks, they are random events, and they can be **spontaneous** (mistakes in natural biological processes) or induced (caused by environmental agents)
> - Here, we see a testing method used to determine if a substance causes Mutations

# Mutations May Be Spontaneous or Induced
