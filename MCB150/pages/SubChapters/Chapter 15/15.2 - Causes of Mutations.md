# Mutations May Be Spontaneous or Induced

- Biologists categorize the mutation as spontaneous or induced
- **Spontaneous Mutations** result from abnormalities in biological processes
  - They are reflections showing that biology isn't perfect
  - Enzymes also can work in abnormal way
- Anyways, we have DNA polymerase fucking up and literaly metabolic processes making free radicals that can explode DNA and alter its structure
- Finally, structures of the nucleotides are not inherently stable, so structures of the base may spontaneously change, and this change causes a mutation if it happens immediately before DNA Replication

- Rates of these spontaneous Mutations are not the same from species to species and from gene to gene
- Larger genes are more likely to incur mutations than are smaller ones, and the common rate of spontaneous mutation is around 1 per 1 million genes per cell division
  - This random mutation is the **RAW MATERIAL OF EVOLUTION**
 
- **Induced mutations** are caused by environmental Agents entering the cell, altering the structure of DNA
- They cause the mutation rate to be higher than spontaneous mutation rate, and these agents are called **mutagens**
- Mutagenic agents can be chemical or physical mutagens; Effects will be considered next

# Mutagens Alter DNA Structure in Different Ways
- We have found a lot of mutagens so far. They are terrifying and cause cancer and could ruin one person's offspring

## *Chemical Mutagens*
- Some chemical mutagens act by covalently modifying the structure of nucleotides
  - E.g. nitrous acid deaminates bases by replacing amino groups with keto groups (-NH<sub/>2</sub> with =O)
  - This can change cytosine to uracil and when this altered DNA replicates, the modified base does not pair with the appropriate base in the newly made strand
  - In this case, uracil pairs with adenine

- Similarly, 5-bromouracil and 2-aminopurine, base analogues, have structures similar to bases in DNA and can substitute them
  - DO NOT use them for DNA replication or ELSE
- Other chemical mutagens disrupt the appropriate pairing between nucleotides by alkylating bases in DNA
  - During alkylation, methyl or ethyl groups are covalently attached to the bases
  - E.g. Nitrogen mustards and ethyl methanesulfonate which is used as a mutagen in laboratory experiments
- Some other chemical mutagens take place in interfering with DNA replication
  - E.g. Benzo[a]pyrene, in automobile exhaust and charbroiled food, is betabolized into a benzopyrene diol epoxide that inserts between bases of double helix, distorting the helical structure

## *Physical Mutagens*
- DNA molecules are also sensitive to physical agents such as radiation
- Radiation of short wavelength and high energy, known as ionizing radiation, alters DNA structure
  - E.g. X-rays gamma rays
  - This radiation penetrates deeply into biological materials, making free radicals
- Free Radicals can alter the structure of DNA in a variety of ways
  - Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation causes base deletions, breaks in one DNA strand, or even a break in both DNA strands
- Nonionizing radiation, like UV light, contains less energy, and so it penetrates only the surface of biological materials, like the skin
  - Still causes mutations lol, forming like a **thymine dimer** which is a site where two adjacent thymine bases bec ome covalently crosslinked to each other

- Sometimes these dimers are repaired during or before DNA replication
  - If the repair fails to occur, a thymine dimer may cause mutations when the DNA strand is replicated
  - Now we have improper base pairing and now we have gaps in the newly made strand or the incorporation of incorrect bases

# Testing Methods Determine If an Agent Is a Mutagen
- **Ames test**, by Bruce AMes, uses a strain of bacterium, *Salmonella typhimurium*, unable to synthesize histidine
- This strain has a point mutation needed to encode an enzyme for histidine biosynthesis
  - I mean, at first the mutation leaves the enzyme inactive, and the bacteria cannot grow unless histidine is added to the growth medium, but a second mutation could correct the first mutation, restoring the ability to synthesize histidine
  - The Ames test monitors the rate which this second mutation occurs and thereby indicates whether an agent increases the mutation rate above the spontaneous rate
- Here we see how the Ames test occurs
  - Suspected Mutagen is mixed with a rat liver extract and the strain of *S. typhimurium* that cannot synthesize histidine
  - As some potential mutagens may require activation by cellular enzymes, the rat liver extract provides a mixture of enzymes that may cause such activation
  - This step improves the ability to identify agents causing mutations in mammals
  - As a control, bacteria not exposed to mutagen is also tested

- After an Incubation period, some mutations could occur, and a large number of bacteria are placed on a growth medium not containing histidine
  - Normally, it doesn't live, but if it mutates right, it will make a visible bacterial colony
- Now to estimate mutation rate, and the colonies are growing in the absence of histidine are counted and compared with the total number of bacterial cells originally placed on the plate for both the suspected-mutagen sample and the control.
  - Control is the measure of spontaneous mutation rate, and the other sample measures rate of mutation in the presence of the suspected mutagen
- E.g. 2 million bacteria plated from both control and suspected-mutagen tubes
  - In the control, 2 bacterial colonies were observed
  - Spontaneous rate found by dividing by 2 by 2 million , or 1 in 1 million
  - Let's say the mutagen colonies got 44, so if we do 44/ 2 million, then we got a 2.2e-5 mutation rate, over 20 times higher than the spontaneous mutation rate
- How do we judge if it is a mutagen?
  - Statistical analysis
