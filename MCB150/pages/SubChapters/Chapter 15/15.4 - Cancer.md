> - Some cancers have a genetic predisposition, but more do not have a genetic predisposition
> - Most of us just suffer from **Carcinogens** (basically a fancier name for Mutagens)
> - But how does cancer occur? In most cases, the development of cancer is a multistep process
>   - Usually from a single cell, and its daughter cells, undergo a series of mutations and other genetic changes that cause the cells to grow abnormally
>   - At an early stage, the cells form a tumor, an abnormal overgrowth of cells. For most cancers, growth begins as a precancerous mass, a benign tumor. They do not invade adjacent tissues and do not spread throughout the body
>   - This is followed by more genetic changes that cause some cells to lose normal growth regulation, making a malignant tumor. Now you got cancer
>   - Cancerous tumors invade adjacent healthy tissues, and cancer cells may spready through the bloodstream and surrounding body fluids, a process called **metastasis**
> - Now the malignant cells cause the death of the organism

> Caption: Cancer: its typical progression and effects. (a) In a healthy individual, a few mutations convert a normal
cell into a tumor cell. This cell divides to produce a benign tumor. Additional mutations and other changes in the tumor
cells may occur, leading to a malignant tumor. At a later stage in malignancy, the tumor cells invade surrounding
tissues, and some malignant cells may metastasize by traveling through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. (b)

been ravaged by lung cancer. This lung was taken from a person who was a heavy smoker.

> - Over the last few decades, we have also found genes promoting cancer when they are mutant.
> - Comparing function of each mutant gene with the corresponding nonmutant gene found in healthy cells, shows 2 categories of cancer-promoting genes
>   1. Some mutations cause the gene to be overactive, an abnormally high level of expression. Overactivity contributes to uncontrolled cell growth in cancer cells, this is called an oncogene
>   2. When a tumor-suppressor gene is normal, it makes a protein to prevent cancer. If a mutation eliminates this gene, cancer may occur
> - These two categories of cancer-causing genes are based on the effects of mutations.
> - Onco genes: Results of mutations causing overactivity
> - Cancer-casuing mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are due to loss of activity. This section, we begin talking about oncogenes then tumor-suppressor genes

# Oncogenes May Result From Mutations That Cause the Overactivity of Proteins Involved with Cell Division
- Over the Past 4 decades, researchers found many oncogenes
- Oncogenes encode proteins that function in the signal transduction pathway involved in cell growth
- Cell Division is regulated by growth factors, a protein that binds to a receptor (Receptor activation)
- This stimulates an intracellular signal transduction pathway that activates transcription factors. This way, the transcription of specific genes is activated in response to a growth factor. After they are made, the gene promotes cell divsion

- Eukaryotic species produce many different growth factors that play a role in cell division
- Likewise, cells have several types of signal transduction pathways, composd of proteins responding to growth factors that promote cell division
- Mutations in the genes that encode these signal transduction proteins can change them into oncogenes

- BUT HOW DO THESE ONCOGENES PROMOTE CANCER?
  - In some cases, an oncogene may keep a signal transduction pathway for cell division in a permanent "on" state.
  - One way oncogenes keep cell division turned on is by producing a functionally overactive protein
  - E.g. Lets see how a mutation affects intracellular signaling protein called Ras
    - Ras protein is a GTPase hydrolyzing GTP to GDP + P<sub/>i</sub>
    - When a signal transduction pathway is activated, the Ras protein releases GDP and binds GTP.
    - When GTP is bound, the activated Ras protein promotes cell division, returning to its inactive state by hydrolyzing its bound GTP and cell divsion becomes inhibited
    - Mutations could then convert the normal *ras* gene to an oncogene, decreasing its performance in hydrolyzing GTP or increasing the rate of exchange of bound GDP for GTP
    - Both changes result in more activate GTP-bound form of the Ras protein, keeping the signal transduction pathway turned on when it should not be, causing uncontrolled cell division
