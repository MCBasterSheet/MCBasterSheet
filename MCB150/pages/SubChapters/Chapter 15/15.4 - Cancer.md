> Caption: Cancer: its typical progression and effects. (a) In a healthy individual, a few mutations convert a normal
cell into a tumor cell. This cell divides to produce a benign tumor. Additional mutations and other changes in the tumor
cells may occur, leading to a malignant tumor. At a later stage in malignancy, the tumor cells invade surrounding
tissues, and some malignant cells may metastasize by traveling through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. (b)

# Oncogenes May Result From Mutations That Cause the Overactivity of Proteins Involved with Cell Division
- Over the Past 4 decades, researchers found many oncogenes
- Oncogenes encode proteins that function in the signal transduction pathway involved in cell growth
- Cell Division is regulated by growth factors, a protein that binds to a receptor (Receptor activation)
- This stimulates an intracellular signal transduction pathway that activates transcription factors. This way, the transcription of specific genes is activated in response to a growth factor. After they are made, the gene promotes cell divsion

- Eukaryotic species produce many different growth factors that play a role in cell division
- Likewise, cells have several types of signal transduction pathways, composd of proteins responding to growth factors that promote cell division
- Mutations in the genes that encode these signal transduction proteins can change them into oncogenes

> Examples of Genes encoding Signal Transduction Proteins that Can Become Oncogenes

- BUT HOW DO THESE ONCOGENES PROMOTE CANCER?
  - In some cases, an oncogene may keep a signal transduction pathway for cell division in a permanent "on" state.
  - One way oncogenes keep cell division turned on is by producing a functionally overactive protein
  - E.g. Lets see how a mutation affects intracellular signaling protein called Ras
    - Ras protein is a GTPase hydrolyzing GTP to GDP + P<sub/>i</sub>
    - When a signal transduction pathway is activated, the Ras protein releases GDP and binds GTP.
    - When GTP is bound, the activated Ras protein promotes cell division, returning to its inactive state by hydrolyzing its bound GTP and cell divsion becomes inhibited
    - Mutations could then convert the normal *ras* gene to an oncogene, decreasing its performance in hydrolyzing GTP or increasing the rate of exchange of bound GDP for GTP
    - Both changes result in more activate GTP-bound form of the Ras protein, keeping the signal transduction pathway turned on when it should not be, causing uncontrolled cell division

# Mutations in Proto-Oncogenes Convert Them to Oncogenes
- What things make oncogenes?
- **Proto-oncogenes** is a normal gene, that if mutated, can become an oncogene
  - Remember, **oncogenes** are genes affected in a way causing it to be overexpressed or expressed in the wrong cell type
- Missense Mutations, Gene Amplifications, chromosomal translocations, and retroviral insertions can all convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes

> Images showing common genetic changes converting proto-oncogenes to oncogenes

> ![image](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/assets/157453648/c86b14e4-f7af-4309-adc3-5c79bfc4d7bc)

## *Missense Mutation*
- A change to a single amino acid in a protein, altering the function of a protein
- In this case, the altered function of a protein promotes cancer, and this mutation (in *E. coli*) converts the *ras* gene into an oncogene
  - e.g. *ras* gene to a specific glycine to a valine in the Ras protein, decreasing ability for Ras to hydrolyze GTP to keep Ras protein in the GTP-bound form promoting cell divsion
- Mutagens have also been found to cause missense mutations too, leading to cancer

## *Gene Amplification*
- Another genetic events occuring is an increase in the number of copies of a proto-oncogene
- An abnormal increase in the number of genes results in too much protein
- Many human cancers are associated with overamplification of a particular proto-oncogene
  - Mark Groudine found the *myc* gene which encodes a transcription factor, amplified in human leukemia

## *Chromosomal Translocation*
- This is when one segment of a chromosome is attached to a different chromosome
- Peter Nowell found a form of leukemia called chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) correlated with a shortened version of human chromosomes
  - This shortened chromosome translocation occurs with Chromosome 9 and 22 exchanging pieces
  - This activates a proto-oncogene, *abl*, and has it merge with *bcr* gene that should normally be on a different chromosome
  - In CML these chromosomes break apart and rejoin that the promoter and the first part of *bcr* fuse with part of *abl*, and this fused gene acts as an oncogene that encodes a fusion protein whose overactivity leads to leukemia

## *Retroviral Insertion*
- Certain types of viruses convert proto-oncogenes into oncogenes during the viral replication cycle
- Retroviruses insert their DNA into the chromosomal DNA of a host cell, a viral genome containing a promoter and regulatory elements to express viral genes
- Sometimes the viral DNA inserts themselves into a host chromosome in a way that a viral promoter and regulatory elements are next to a proto-oncogene, overexpressing it, promoting cancer
- Or the virus just carries an oncogene in its viral genome

# Some Types of Cancers Are Caused by Viruses
- Few viruses cause cancer in plants and animals

- 1911 we found the first cancer-causing virus from a chicken carcomas by Peyton Rous
  - Sarcoma is a tumor of connective tissue like bone/cartilage
  - They named it the Rous Sarcoma Virus and they found the viral gene acted like an oncogene
- The main point though is to just look at the way that putting the *src* gene from a chicken into a virus seems to really make an oncogene. Proto-oncogenes in viruses = death :(

# Tumor-Suppresor Genes Prevent Mutations or Cell Proliferation
- Normal tumor-suppressor genes prevents cancerous growths
  - These proteins can maintain genome integrity or negative regulation of cell-division

## *Maintenance of Genome Integrity*
- Some tumor-suppressor genes maintain the integrity of the genome by monitoring or repairing genome alterations
- They prevent gene mutations, DNA breaks, improperly segregated chromosomes, etc.
- **Checkpoint proteins** prevent a cell from advancing through the cell cycle if an abnormality is detected
  - Called this way as they check the integrity of the genome to prevent a cell from progressing past a certain point in the cell cycle
  - They work by controlling proteins called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) which advance a cell through the four phases of the cell cycle
  - Formation of activated cdk complexes can be stopped by checkpoint proteins
  - One example is p53, a proteins controlling whether cells advance from G1 to the S phase
    - Arnold Levine found it, and it is the protein which is 53 kilodaltons and 50% of all human cancers are associated with this gene mutating
    - If the damage in DNA is found, it stops it and repairs the DNA during the cell cycle, and if the DNA is repaired, the cell may proceed
    - Otherwise, it kills the cell through **apoptosis**, shrinking the cell and degrading DNA
      - Here, enzymes known as caspases are activated and are proteases that execute the cell.
      - They digest selected cellular proteins like microfilaments, those that make up the cytoskeleton, causing the cell to be broken into small vesicles that are eventually phagocytized by cells of the immune system

## *Negative Regulation of Cell Division**
- Proteins that function properly to halt cell division
- If lost, cell division is abnormally accelerated
- One example is the *Rb* gene
  - First one identified from retinoblastoma, cancerous tumor in the retina of the eye
  - The protein negatively controls a regulatory transcription factor called E2F that activates a gene required for cell cycles progression from G1 to S phase
  - Binding Rb to E2F inhibits E2F activity and prevents cell division
  - If a cell is supposed to divide, cyclins bind to cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), activating the kinases, catalyzing the transpher of phosphate to the Rb protein
    - Phosphorylating Rb protein causes it to be released from the E2F, letting E2F activate genes to advance the cell cycle
  - If both copies of Rb are defective due to mutations, the E2F protein is always active, explaining uncontrolled cell divsion in  retinoblastoma

# Gene Mutations, Chromosome Loss, and CHanges in Chromatin Structure Can Inhibit the Expression of Tumor-Suppressor Genes
- How are tumor-suppressor genes silences?
- 3 Ways

## *Inactivation of Tumor-Suppressor Genes via Mutation*
- A mutation could occur in a tumor-suppressor gene to inactivate its function
  - E.g. a mutation could abolish the function of the promoter for a tumor-supressor gene or introduce an early stop codon into the coding sequence

## *Chromosome Loss*
- Can contribute to progression of cancer if missing chromosome carries 1+ tumor-suppressor genes

## *Epigenetic Changes*
- These are changes involving changing chromatin structure altering gene expression without altering base sequence of DNA
  - E.g. Tumor-suppressor genes in cancer cells can be methylated, and transcription is inhibited when CpG islands near a promoter are methylated
  - DNA methylation near promoters of tumor-suppressor genes have been found in many types of tumors, so this gene inactivation plays an important role in forming/progressing malignancy

# Most Forms of Cancer Are Caused by a Series of Genetic Changes That Progressively Alter the Growth Properties of Cells
- Many times, multiple genetic changes to the same cell lineage (10 or more!) are needed for cancer to occur
- These changes involve overexpression of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppression genes
- Many benign cancers just have more genetic changes leading to malignancy
- And then the malign cells, dividing faster, are more difficult to treat and can have faster genetic changes
- Now lets see lung cancer
  - Deadly and within 5 years, 15% survive
  - How does it happen?
    - They are Carcinomas (cancer of epithelial cells）
    - In the picture below, you see the top photo as a healthy lung and the rest as a carinoma progressing in basal cells
- Progression of cancer:
  1. Cancer happens due to accumulations of mutations in cell ineage, beginning with initial mutant cell that then divides multiple times to make a lot of daughter cells. As mutations add up, the number increases dramatically, thickening epithelium causing hyperplasia
  2. Proliferatino of the basal cells cause loss of ciliated columnar epithelial cells normally lining the airways to help remove mucus and its trapped particles from the lungs
  3. More Mutations, more abnormal morphologies causing dysplasia. In early stages, abnormal basal cells are precancerous, but if the source of chronic irritation (cigarette smoke) is removed, the abnormal cells are likely to disappear
  4. If smoking continues, the abnormal cells may accumulate additional genetic changes and los their ability to stop dividing. Such cells are now cancerous, and the person has basal cell carinoma
 
### It gets worse :(
- The basement membrane is a sheetlike layer of extracellular matrix providing a barrier between the lung cells and the bloodstream
- If the cancer cells haven't penetrated the basement membrane, they haven't metastasized yet (went into the blood)
- Lower images in the image below show a tumor breaking through the basement membrane, and likely leading to the death of the patient
- By the way, since cancer requires many mutations to occur randomly, you literally never know when it will strike. Being old doesn't help either

# Core Concept: Evolution
**Mutations in Approximately 300 Human Genes May Promote Cancer**
- We found a lot of genes mutated in cancer cells, and while they don't all change the growth rate, they can provide a growth advantage for the cell populations where cancer developed
  - E.g. Being able to grow in another area than just your lungs
- How many genes can do this?
  - Read the header lol
  - with 22000 protein coding genes, this means over 1% of our genes can promote cancer if their expression is altered by a mutation or an epigenetic change (ZAMN!)
