> # Learning Goals
> 1. Outline the steps in the development of Cancer
> 2. Describe the general functions of oncogenes
> 3. List the four common types of genetic changes that convert proto-oncogenes into oncogenes
> 4. Identify the two general functions of the proteins encoded by tumor-suppressor genes
> 5. Describe 3 common ways that tumor-suppressor genes are silenced
>
> - Cancer is uncontrolled cell division and is the leading cause of death in humans
> - Some cancers have a genetic predisposition, but more do not have a genetic predisposition
> - Most of us just suffer from **Carcinogens** (basically a fancier name for Mutagens)
> - But how does cancer occur? In most cases, the development of cancer is a multistep process
>   - Usually from a single cell, and its daughter cells, undergo a series of mutations and other genetic changes that cause the cells to grow abnormally
>   - At an early stage, the cells form a tumor, an abnormal overgrowth of cells. For most cancers, growth begins as a precancerous mass, a benign tumor. They do not invade adjacent tissues and do not spread throughout the body
>   - This is followed by more genetic changes that cause some cells to lose normal growth regulation, making a malignant tumor. Now you got cancer
>   - Cancerous tumors invade adjacent healthy tissues, and cancer cells may spready through the bloodstream and surrounding body fluids, a process called **metastasis**
> - Now the malignant cells cause the death of the organism
>

> Caption: Cancer: its typical progression and effects. (a) In a healthy individual, a few mutations convert a normal
cell into a tumor cell. This cell divides to produce a benign tumor. Additional mutations and other changes in the tumor
cells may occur, leading to a malignant tumor. At a later stage in malignancy, the tumor cells invade surrounding
tissues, and some malignant cells may metastasize by traveling through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. (b)
On the left in the photo is a human lung that was obtained from a healthy nonsmoker. The lung shown on the right has
been ravaged by lung cancer. This lung was taken from a person who was a heavy smoker.

> - Over the last few decades, we have also found genes promoting cancer when they are mutant.
> - Comparing function of each mutant gene with the corresponding nonmutant gene found in healthy cells, shows 2 categories of cancer-promoting genes
>   1. Some mutations cause the gene to be overactive, an abnormally high level of expression. Overactivity contributes to uncontrolled cell growth in cancer cells, this is called an oncogene
>   2. When a tumor-suppressor gene is normal, it makes a protein to prevent cancer. If a mutation eliminates this gene, cancer may occur
> - These two categories of cancer-causing genes are based on the effects of mutations.
> - Onco genes: Results of mutations causing overactivity
> - Cancer-casuing mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are due to loss of activity. This section, we begin talking about oncogenes then tumor-suppressor genes
