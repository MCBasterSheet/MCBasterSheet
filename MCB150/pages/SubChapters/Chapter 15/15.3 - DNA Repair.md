> # Learning Goals
> 1. List the general features of DNA repair systems
> 2. Describes the steps of nucleotide excision repair
> 3. Explain the connection between a defect in DNA repair and the inherited human disease xeroderma pigmentosum
>
> - All living organisms have mechanisms of DNA repair
> - We got things like DNA polymerase, but we will see more types of DNA repair systmes to detect abnormalities in DNA structure to repair them
> - Each occurrence of mutations have several DNA repair systems to help fix different types of DNA alternations
> - Each DNA repair system is made of 1+ proteins to play specific roles in the repair mechanism
> - DNA repair requires 2 coordinated events, first being a protein to detect the irregularity and the second, the abnormality is repaired
> - Some cases, the change in DNA structure can be directly repaired, like the attachment of an alkyl group (-CH<sub/>2</sub>CH<sub/>3</sub>) to the base
>   - In direct repair, an enzyme removes this alkyl group, restoring the structure of the original base
> - More commonly, the altered DNA is removed and new DNA is synthesized
> - This section examines nucleotide excision repair, a system found in all species

# Nucleotide Excision Repair Removes Segments of Damaged DNA
- **Nucleotide Excision Repair**(NER) has a region of several nucleotides in the damaged strand removed from the DNA, and the intact undamaged strand is used as template for resynthesis of a normal complementary strand
- NER can fix many types of DNA damage, like UV-induced damage (dimers, modified bases, and missing bases)
- With it being found in all species, you can best understand it in bacteria, because that is all we really study
- In *E. coli*, the NER system has 4 key proteins: UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, and UvrD
  - Uvr because they are involved in Ultraviolet light repair of thymine dimers, but also repair chemically damaged DNA
  - Additionally, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase are required to complete the repair process
- HOW THOUGH?
  1. Two UvrA proteins and one UvrB protein form a complex that tracks along the DNA (below). Damaged DNA will have a distorted double helix, sensed by the UvrA-UvrB complex
  2. When the complex finds a damaged site, 2 UvrA proteins are released, and UvrC inds to UvrB at the site
  3. The UvrC protein makes incisions in one DNA strand on oth sides of the damaged site
  4. After incision, UvrC is released, UvrD binds to UvrBï¼Œ UvrD begins to separate the DNA strands, UvrB is released. The action of UvrD unravels DNA, removes a short DNA strand containing the damaged regions so UvrD is released
  5. After the damaged DNA strand is removed, a gap is left in the double helix. DNA polymerase fills the gap using the undamaged strand as a template. Finally, DNA ligase makes the final covalent connection between the the newly made DNA and the original DNA strand.

# Human Genetic Diseases Occur When a Component of the NER System is Missing
- NER systems were found by analyzing genetic diseases affecting DNA repair including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP THE THING THEY KEEP BRINGING UP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS)
- Photosensitivity is a common characteristic in individuals with these syndromes as they have an inability to repair UV-induced lesions. Therefore, people with either of these syndromes must avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight, as do the children at Camp Sundown (opening children lol don't worry)
- Anyways, sunlight exposure causes pigmentation changes, precancerous lesions, and a predisposition to developing skin cancer
