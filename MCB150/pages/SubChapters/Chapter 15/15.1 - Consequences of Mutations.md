# Gene Mutations May Alter the DNA Sequence of a Gene
- Two basic types of chnages in a gene:
   1. The base sequence of a gene is changed
    2. 1+ base pairs are removed or added from a gene
- **Point Mutations** only affect a single base pair of DNA
  - E.g. In the image below, a **base substitution** of T being replaced with a G and a A being replace with a C

- A point mutation also involves adding or deleting a single base pair to a DNA sequence
  - E.g. a base pair A-T is added to the DNA

# Gene Mutations May Affect the Amino Acid Sequence of a Polypeptide
- If a mutation affects the coding region of a protein-coding gene, the mutation may alter that sequence in a variety of ways

## *Silent Mutations*
- They do not alter the amino acid sequence despite the changing of a nucleotide
- This is due to degeneracy in the genetic code

## *Missense Mutation*
- A base substitution that changes a single amino acid in a polypeptide sequence
- Doesn't always alter protein function, as a single amino acid changing can't be that bad*
  - *If the amino acid is chemically similar to the original amino acid
- Sometimes it will just ruin you though so be careful ðŸ’¯

## *Nonsense Mutations*
- Changing a normal codon to a stop codon, terminating earlier than expected making a **truncated polypeptide**

## *Frameshift Mutations*
- Addition or Deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of 3 (1,2,4,5, never anything N*3 where N is any Natural Number)
- Creates a huge difference in the mutation and likely to inhibit protein functions
- And one last thing: Adding 2,4,5 nucleotides is not a point mutation anymore as it involves more than one nucleotide; however, it is still a frameshift mutation that occurred in the coding sequence of a gene

## *Mutations and Natural Selection*
- **Natural Selection** is the process where some traits are more or less common in future generations
- Some mutations are neutral and not acted upon by natural selection as they don't affect an organism's reproductive success
  - In Contrast, others may alter protein functions that determines how well an organism can survive and reproduce
  - These are either deleterious or beneficial mutations
- Either way, just remember, you are more likely to get a deleterious mutation than a beneficial one with a protein of an enhanced function

# Mutations in the Coding Sequences of a Gene Are Known to Cause Many Human Diseases
- Mutations cause a lot of diseases, and if these mutations came from the germ line that gives rise to sperm or egg cells, these mutations can be passed from parent to offspring
- There also be others like cancer cells that are not passed from parent to offspring

- We consider Sickle Cell Disease, a mutation causing symptons at the molecular and cellular level
   - With a missense mutation in HBB gene, making B-globin, the sixth amino acid is changed from glutamic acid to a valine
   - And with glutamic acid being hydrophilic while valine is supposed to be phobic, this single amino acid difference changes the structure and function of the hemoglobin protein
   - This mutant hemoglobin has its subunits stick to each other when O2 is low, and this makes a fiber-like structure in red blood cells, making the cells lose their normal dis shaped morphology to become Sickle-shaped (pretty cool, right?)

# Gene Mutations Occuring Outside of Coding Sequences Can Influence Gene Expression
- A mutation could occur in the noncoding DNA sequence and affect gene expression (not this shit again)
   - E.g. a Mutation could alter the promoting sequence of a gene, affecting rate of transcription or affect how well RNA polymerase could bind to the promoter to enhance transcription, whereas others may inhibit transcription
- Mutations in regulatory Elements or operator sites can alter the regulation of gene transcription
   - E.g. Regulatory elements like the *lac* operator in E. Coli (recognized by a *lac* repressor protein) can be mutated toa ffect proper regulation of the *lac* operon, and since the repressor protein just does not bind, the operon is continually expressed

# Mutations Can Occur in Germ-Line or Somatic Cells
- Multicellular Organisms spend life as a single fertilized egg dividing many times to become an adult, so a mutation in the early stage in life vs as an adult changes the severity of the genetic effect and the ability for the mutation to be passed to offspring

## *Germ-Line Mutations**
- Germ Line refers to cells given rise to gametes like egg and sperm cells
- These mutations occur directly in an egg or sperm cell, or in the precursor cell making a gamete
- If a mutant human gamete fertilizes, all the cells of the resulting offspring will have the mutation
- Lastly, passing it down is likely a 50/50 chance as humans carry two copies of most genes

## *Somatic Mutations*
- **Somatic Cells** constitute all cells in the body except for the germ line
   - E.g. Muscle cells, skin cells
- Mutations could occur in the somatic cells at early or late stages in development
- If you look at the image above (AAAAAHHHH!!! PENIS!) a mutation could occur in a single embryonic cell, and the single somatic cell was the precursor for many cells of the adult
   - Therefore, in the adult, the patch of tissue cells carry the mutation
   - Size of patch depends on timing of mutation, where earlier the mutation, larger the patch
   - An individual with somatic regions genetically different from others is called a **mosaic**
- Below, you see a bitch ass kid with a streak of white hair. **_PRESUMABLY_** This kid had a somatic mutation during an early stage of development

- Fortunate for the kid, and unfortunate for me, this change in hair color is not harmful
- However, a lot of mutations early on are quite harmful, especially if they disrupt developmental processes
   - Please do not mutate your future children by staying near environmental agents that cause mutations at **any stage in life**, like seriously.
