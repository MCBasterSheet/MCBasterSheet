# Gene Mutations May Alter the DNA Sequence of a Gene
- Two basic types of chnages in a gene:
   1. The base sequence of a gene is changed
    2. 1+ base pairs are removed or added from a gene
- **Point Mutations** only affect a single base pair of DNA
  - E.g. In the image below, a **base substitution** of T being replaced with a G and a A being replace with a C

- A point mutation also involves adding or deleting a single base pair to a DNA sequence
  - E.g. a base pair A-T is added to the DNA

# Gene Mutations May Affect the Amino Acid Sequence of a Polypeptide
- If a mutation affects the coding region of a protein-coding gene, the mutation may alter that sequence in a variety of ways

## *Silent Mutations*
- They do not alter the amino acid sequence despite the changing of a nucleotide
- This is due to degeneracy in the genetic code

## *Missense Mutation*
- A base substitution that changes a single amino acid in a polypeptide sequence
- Doesn't always alter protein function, as a single amino acid changing can't be that bad*
  - *If the amino acid is chemically similar to the original amino acid
- Sometimes it will just ruin you though so be careful ðŸ’¯

## *Nonsense Mutations*
- Changing a normal codon to a stop codon, terminating earlier than expected making a **truncated polypeptide**

## *Frameshift Mutations*
- Addition or Deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of 3 (1,2,4,5, never anything N*3 where N is any Natural Number)
- Creates a huge difference in the mutation and likely to inhibit protein functions
- And one last thing: Adding 2,4,5 nucleotides is not a point mutation anymore as it involves more than one nucleotide; however, it is still a frameshift mutation that occurred in the coding sequence of a gene

## *Mutations and Natural Selection*
- **Natural Selection** is the process where some traits are more or less common in future generations
- Some mutations are neutral and not acted upon by natural selection as they don't affect an organism's reproductive success
  - In Contrast, others may alter protein functions that determines how well an organism can survive and reproduce
  - These are either deleterious or beneficial mutations
- Either way, just remember, you are more likely to get a deleterious mutation than a beneficial one with a protein of an enhanced function
