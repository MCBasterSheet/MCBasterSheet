> # Learning Goals
> 1. List several ways that mutations can alter the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide
> 2. Describe examples of how mutations can cause human genetic diseases
> 3. Explian how mutations that occur outside of the coding sequence can affect the expression of a gene
> 4. Compare and Contrast the effects of mutations in somatic cells versus germ-line cells
>
> - We will see how Changing DNA sequence in gene changes gene function
> - Most understanding came from fucking with Bacteria and the Drosophila
>   - Easy to mutate, short generation time, etc.
> - Structure and amount of genetic material can change in a vareity of ways, like chromosomal number
>   - That's for Chapter 16 though
> - Here, we focus gene mutations which are small changes in a sequence of bases in a particular gene
> - We Also see how timing of new mutations during an Organism's development has GRAVE (or just important) Consequences
