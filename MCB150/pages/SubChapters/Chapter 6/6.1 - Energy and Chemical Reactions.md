> `Generalized chemical Reaction: aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD`
>
> A and B are reactants, C and D are products, and a, b, c, and d are the numbers of moles of reactants and products
> This is a reversible reaction, meaning A and B could be turned to C to D and vice versa.
>
> There are two directions, C+D being made (forward) and A+B being made (reverse direction), both depending on energy and concentrations of all the chemicals.
>
> This section Mainly Covers how the interplay of energy and reactant concentrations govern the direction of a chemical reaction. We will learn that cells use energy for these intermediate molecules, like ATP, to drive chemical reactions in a desired direction

# Energy Exists in Different Forms
  - Energy is the ability to cause change or work
    - Kinetic Energy is the energy associated with movement, like moving a baseball bat from one palce to another
    - Potentional energy is the energy a substanc eorr object possesses due to its structure or locationi
      - Ball held high, or electron in atom due to its position relative to other atoms
      - For electrons, the higher it is, the more potential energy it has
      - The potnetial energy stored in the bonds is **Chemical Potential Energy**
        - Released during chemical reactions
        - Glucose has a lot of potential energy, and it is used to make ATP (energy intermediate)

## Thermodynamics
- We also look into how energy is converted from one form to another.
- This is thermodynamics, and we will consider 2 laws
  - The First law states energy cannot be cdreated or destroyed and can only be transferred
  - The second law states any energy transfer or transformation only occurs to increase the entropy of a system.
- These laws put limits on the way that living cells can use energy for its own needs

# The Change in Free Energy Determiens the Direction of a Chemical Reaction
- To see how organisms use energy, we need to determine eusage energy and unusable energy in biology
> Total Energy = Usable Energy + Unusuable Energy
- Why is some energy unusable? The main culprit is entropy
  - Entropy is unable to be used
- Do not confuse it with enthalpy, the total energy of the system
- Usable energy is free energy (G) which is Gibbs free energy
  - He proposed 3 things composing a system's energy
  - H = G + TS
  - T = absolute temperature in kelvin
- To determine if a process is spontaneous (not meaning fast), you need the change of free-energy for a reaction
  - ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
- If the reactiants have more energy than the products, spontaneous and exergonic
  - Favors conversion of reactants to products
- Otherwise, it is endergonic and not spontaneous
  - Favors making reactants
 
Example of spontaneous process, ATP and how hydrolysis is a favorable process:

# Cells use ATP to Drive Endergonic Change
- Many biological processes require the addition of free energy as they are endergonic and non-spontaneous
- To overcome the problem, cells pair endergonic reactions with exergonic reactions as the total Gibbs free energy is now negative
- An example of this is **Phosphorylation** where the coupled reaction occurs spontaneously as the net free-energy change is negative
  - Exergonic reactions like breaking down ATP is coupled to chemical reactions and other cellular processes that would otherwise be endergonic

# Genomes Encode Many Proteins That Use ATP as a Source of Energy
- Many processes have been found to use ATp to drive chemical reactions or other cellular processes
- Many amino acids are found to have ATP-binding sites to determine if a newly discover protein uses ATP
  - They would scan entire genomes to determine if they have ATP binding sites
  - Over 20% of all proteins bind ATP, but this number is likely underestimated as there are a lot more unidentified ATP-binding sites
  - Us humans have 4400/22000 genes encoding proteins with ATP use
