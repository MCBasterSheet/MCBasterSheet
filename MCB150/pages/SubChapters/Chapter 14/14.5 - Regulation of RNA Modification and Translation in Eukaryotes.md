> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Outline the process of alternative splicing, and explain how it increases protein diversity
> 2. Explain how RNA-binding protiens regulate the translation of specific mRNAs, using the regulation of iron absorption in mammals as an example
>
> - Preceeding sections of this chapter focused on gene regulation at the level of transcrition in bacteria and eukaryotes
> - Eukaryotic gene expression is also regulated at RNA modification levels and translation
> - These added levels give benefits to eukaryotes
>   - Regulating RNA modification lets more than 1 mRNA transcript be made from a single gene
>   - This lets a gene encode 2+ polypeptides
> - Another issue is timing as regulation of tarnscription in eukaryotes takes a fair amount of time before it is observed
>   - Transcription needs
>     - Chromatin be converted to an open conformation
>     - Genes be transcribed
>     - RNA be modified and exported from the nucleus
>     - Protein be made via translation
>   - These steps take time, needing minutes to even hours
>   - A faster way is to control steps occuring after an RNA transcripts made
>     - Eukaryotes, regulation of translation provides a faster way to regulate levels of gene productions, namely, proteins
>   - The last few decades, many advances has been made in understanding regulation of RNA modeifiation and translation
>     - But still geneticists still find new froms, so it is exciting
>     - So we see a different version of RNAi here, that being alternative splicing and translational regulation via RNA-binding proteins

# Alternative Splicing of Pre-mRNAs Increases Protien Diversity
- Eukaryotes, pre-mRNA transcript is modified before it beocmes a mature mRNA
  - When pre-mRNA has multiple introns and exons, splicing can occur in more than one way, producing 2+ different polypeptide
  - **Alternative splicing** is a form of regulation allowing an organism ot use the same gene to make different proteins at different stages of development, in different cell types, and/or in response to different environmental conditions
- Alternative Splicing is an important form of gene regulation in complex eukaryotes, like animals and plants
  - Alternative splicing lets 2+ polypeptides be derived from a single gene, increasing the proteome size whilst maintaining genome size
- Example: alpha-tropomyosin, a regulator of cell contraction that creates different versions of itself for different levels of contractibility
  - Below shows the intron-exon structure of the rat alpha-tropomyosin pre-mRNA and the two alternative ways it can be spliced
  - The pre-mRNA contains 14 exons, 6 are constitutive (always found)
  - Alternative exons are not always found and could change the function of alpha-tropomyosin to meet th eneeds of the cell type in which it is found

- E.g. THe figure above shows predominant splicing products in smooth muscle cells and striated muscle cells
  - #2 encodes a segment for alpha-tropomyosin protein that alters its function to be more suitable for smooth muscle cells
  - Strated cells don't have exon 2, instead having exon 3
- How is it regulated?
  - Each cell produces a unique set of splicing factors, where proteins altering the ability of the spliceosomes recognize the boundaries between introns and exons
  - Smooth muscle cells produce splicing factors removing 3,7, 111-13
  - Striated muscle cells produce a different set removing 2,7,13,14

# Alternative Splicing is more Prevalent in Complex Eukaryotic Species
- The past few decades had many techincal advances improving our ability to analyze genomes and proteomes of many different species
- Researchers have sequenced the DNA from many species estimating total gene number and estimate number of polypeptides if degree of alternative splicing is also know
- Table below compares 6 species, showing trends tha tless complex organisms have fewer genes
  - But the trend isn't linear... sometimes it just isn't consistent
- Another trend concerns alternative splicing, not occuring in bacteria and is rare in S. cerevisiae
  - Frequency increases from worms to flies to humans
  - Alternative splicing is 10x higher in humans vs fruit flies
  - 22000 protein coding genes with 100000+ polypeptides being made

# The Prevention of Iron Toxicity in Mammals Invovles Regulation of Translation
- RNA-binding proteins directly affect the initiation of translation
- Regulation of iron absorption in mammals provides a well-studied example
  - Iron is a cofactor for many cellular enzymes
  - But is toxic at high levels
  - Ferritin forms hollow spherical complexes storing iron preventing toxicity
- mRNA encoding ferritin is controlled by an RNA-binding protein known as **iron regulatory protein (IRP)**
  - If iron levels are low and ferritin isn't needed, IRP binds to a regulatory element known as the **iron regulatory element (IRE)**, located between the 5` cap where the ribosome binds and the start codon where translation begins. Base pairing causes a stem-loop to form. binding of IRP to IRE inhibits translation of ferritin mRNA
  - When iron is abundant, iron binds to IRP changing its conformation and preventing it from binding to the IRE so ferritin in mRNA is translated to make more ferritin proteins

- Translational regulation has the advantage over transcriptional as it lets cells quickly respond to the environment not needing activation of the ferritin gene and transcription of ferritin mRNA prior to synthesis of more ferritin protein.
