> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Outline the process of alternative splicing, and explain how it increases protein diversity
> 2. Explain how RNA-binding protiens regulate the translation of specific mRNAs, using the regulation of iron absorption in mammals as an example
>
> - Preceeding sections of this chapter focused on gene regulation at the level of transcrition in bacteria and eukaryotes
> - Eukaryotic gene expression is also regulated at RNA modification levels and translation
> - These added levels give benefits to eukaryotes
>   - Regulating RNA modification lets more than 1 mRNA transcript be made from a single gene
>   - This lets a gene encode 2+ polypeptides
> - Another issue is timing as regulation of tarnscription in eukaryotes takes a fair amount of time before it is observed
>   - Transcription needs
>     - Chromatin be converted to an open conformation
>     - Genes be transcribed
>     - RNA be modified and exported from the nucleus
>     - Protein be made via translation
>   - These steps take time, needing minutes to even hours
>   - A faster way is to control steps occuring after an RNA transcripts made
>     - Eukaryotes, regulation of translation provides a faster way to regulate levels of gene productions, namely, proteins
>   - The last few decades, many advances has been made in understanding regulation of RNA modeifiation and translation
>     - But still geneticists still find new froms, so it is exciting
>     - So we see a different version of RNAi here, that being alternative splicing and translational regulation via RNA-binding proteins
