> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Explain how regulatory transcription factors and small effector molecules are involved int the regulation of transcription
> 2. Describe the organization of the *lac* operon, and explain how it is under negative and positive control
> 3. Analyze Jacob, Monod, and Pardee's results
> 4. Explain how the *trp* operon is under negative control
>
> We've seen bacterium exposed to a nutrient in an envrionment expressing genes needed to encode proteins to metabolize sugar. we also seen bacteria have genes encoding enzymes to synthesize molecules like amino acids. These genes require the control of expression occuring at the level of transcription. THis section examines the molecule mechnisms bringing about transcriptional regulation in bacteria.
