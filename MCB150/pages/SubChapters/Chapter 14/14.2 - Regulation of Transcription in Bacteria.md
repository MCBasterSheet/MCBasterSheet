> We've seen bacterium exposed to a nutrient in an envrionment expressing genes needed to encode proteins to metabolize sugar. we also seen bacteria have genes encoding enzymes to synthesize molecules like amino acids. These genes require the control of expression occuring at the level of transcription. THis section examines the molecule mechnisms bringing about transcriptional regulation in bacteria.

# Transcriptional Regulation Involves Regulatory Transcription Factors and Small Effector Molecules
- Most cases, regulation of transcription involves the actions of **Regulatory Transcription Factors**, proteins that bind to regulatory sequences in the DNA, usually found in the vicinity of the promoter affecting rate of transcription of one or more nearby genes
- Transcription factors can increase or decrease rate of transcription
- Repressors are regualtory transcription factors that bind to the DNA and decrease the rate of transcription
  - This is negative control
- Activators bind to the DNA and increase the rate of transcription
  - A form of tested **positive control**

- Molecules called **small effector molecules** play a role in transcriptional regulatory
  - They exert its effects via binding to a regulatory transcription factor and causing conformational change in the protein
  - Many cases, the effect of the conformational change determines whether or not the protein can bind to the DNA
- Above, we see a repressor in the (b) cateogry
  - When the small effect molecule is not in the cytoplasm, the repressor binds to the DNA and ihibits transcription
  - When a small effector molecule is there, it binds to the repressor and causes conformational change inhibiting the ability of the protein to bind to the DNA
  - Transcription can occur because the repressor is not able to bind to the DNA
- Repressors and activators repsonding to small effector molecules have two functional regions called domains
  - One domain is a site where protein binds to the DNA
  - The other is for the small effector molecule

# The *lac* Operon Contains Genes Encoding Proteins Involved in Lactose Metabolism
- In bacteria, 2 or more genes can be under transcriptional control of a single promoter
- This arrangement is an **operon**
  - The genes in the operon are a single unit, resulting in production of polycistronic mRNA, an mRNA encoding more than one protein
  - This gives the advantage of coordinating regulation of genes that encode proteins whose functions are used in common pathways
- The genome of E. coli carries an operon called the ***lac* operon** (lactose operson) containing the genes to metabolize lactose
- Figure below shows the organization of this operon found in E. coli chromosome, and the polycistronic mRNA transcribed from it
- The *lac operon* contains a promoter *lacP*, involved in the transcription of three protein-coding genes: *lacZ, lacY, and lacA*
  - *lacZ* gene encodes Beta-galactosidase, an enzyme breaking down lactose. It also converts a small percentage of lactose into allolactose, a structurally similar sugar, or lactose analogue. Allolactose is important in the regualtion of the *lac* operon
  - *lacY* encodes lactose permease, membrane protein needed to transport lactose into the cytoplasm of bacterium
  - *lacA* gene encodes galatoside transacetylase, covalently modifies lactose and lactose analogues by attaching an acetyl group (-COCH<sub/>3</sub>). Attachment of acetyl groups to nonmetabolizable lactose analogues prevents toxic buildup in the cytoplasm

- Near the *lac* promoter are 2 regulatory sequences designated the oerpator and the CAP site (check out (a) below)
  - The operator (*lacO*) is a regulatory sequence in the DNA
  - The sequence of bases at the operator provides a binding site for a repressor protein
  - The **CAP site** is a regulatory sequence recognized by an activator protein.
- Adjacent to the *lac* operon is the *lacI* gene, encoding the lac repressor
  - This repressor is important in regulation of the *lac* operon
  - The *lacI* gene, constitutively expressed at a low level, has the promoter called the *i* promoter
  - The *lacI* gene is not considered a part of the *lac* operon

# The *lac* Operon is Under Negative Control by a Repressor Protein
- The late 1950s Jacob and Monod at France focused on gene regulation due to the phenomenon of enzyme adaptation
- Enzyme adaptation occurs when a particular enzyme appears in a living cell only when the substrate is exposed to it
- Jacob and Monod studied lactose metabolism in E. coli to investigate this phenomenon, exposing bacteria to lactose
  - Lactose-utilizing enzymes increased by 1e3-1e4 times the normal amount, and after lactose was removed, synthesis stopped.
- The first mechanism of regulation they found involved lac repressors, binding to the sequenes of bases at the *lac* oeprator site
  - Binding results in prevention of RNA polymerase from transcribing *lacZ,Y, and A* genes
  - RNA polymerase can bind to the promoter when the lac repressor is bound to the operator site, but cannot move past the operator to transcribe the Z, Y, and A

- Whether or not the lac respssor binds to the operator site depends on allolactose, the side product of Beta-galactosidase enzyme
  - allolactose controls the lac repressor by being a small effector molecule
  - The lac repressor protein contains 4 identical subunits, each recognizing a single allolactose molecule
  - When the 4 bind to the lac repressor, a conformation change occurs preventing repressor from binding to the oeprator
  - Under these condition, RNA polymerase is free to transcribe the operon
- Regulation of the *lac* operon enables E. coli to conserve energy as lactose-utilizing protiens are made only when lactose is present in the environment
- Allolactose is an **inducer**, a small effector molecule increasing transcription rate, and the *lac* operon is an **inducible operon**
- When the bacterium is not exposed to lactose, no allolactose is available to bind to the lac repressor
  - Thus, lac repressors binds to the operator site and inhibits transcription
  - In reality, the repressor doesn't inhibit it completely, as small amounts of Beta-galactosidase, lactose permease, and galactoside transacetylase are made
  - But not enough to readily use lactose
- When bacterium is exposed to lactose, small amounts can be transported into the cytoplasm via lactose permease and Beta-galactosidase converts some to allolactose
  - The cytoplasmic level of allolactose gradually rises until allolactose binds to the lac repressor, inducing the *lac* operon and promoting high rates of transcription of the *lacZ, Y, and A* genes
  - Translation of the encoded polypeptides produces the proteins needed for lactose uptake and metabolism

# Feature Investigation | Jacob, Monod, and Pardee Studied a Constitutive Mutant to Deterine the Function of the Lac Repressor
- As it turns out, lac repressors bind to the *lac* operator site to exert its effects
- How did they figure this out?
- They used *lac* operson regulation coming from studies involving E. coli strains showing abnormalities in  the process
- Jacob, Monod, and co and Pardee found few mutants expressing *lac* operson constitutively, so *lacZ, Y, and A* were expressed even in the absence of the lactose in environment
  - They discovered some mutations caused this and occurred in the *lacI* region of the DNA
  - Such strands are *lacI<sup/>-</sup>* to indicate non-functionality
  - Normal is *lacI<sup/>+</sup>*
- Initially thought *lacI<sup/>+</sup>* encodes an enzyme that degrades an internal inducer of the *lac* operson*
  - *lacI<sup/>-</sup>* inhibits the enzyme, letting continuous synthesis
  - *lacI<sup/>-</sup>* made is unnecessary for cells to be exposed to lactose for induction
- Then they found that *lacI* encodes a repressor protein, so *lacI* genes just eliminates the synthesis of the functional lac repressor and prevents the lac repressor protein from inhibiting transcription
