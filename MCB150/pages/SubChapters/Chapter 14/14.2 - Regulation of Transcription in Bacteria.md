> We've seen bacterium exposed to a nutrient in an envrionment expressing genes needed to encode proteins to metabolize sugar. we also seen bacteria have genes encoding enzymes to synthesize molecules like amino acids. These genes require the control of expression occuring at the level of transcription. THis section examines the molecule mechnisms bringing about transcriptional regulation in bacteria.

# Transcriptional Regulation Involves Regulatory Transcription Factors and Small Effector Molecules
- Most cases, regulation of transcription involves the actions of **Regulatory Transcription Factors**, proteins that bind to regulatory sequences in the DNA, usually found in the vicinity of the promoter affecting rate of transcription of one or more nearby genes
- Transcription factors can increase or decrease rate of transcription
- Repressors are regualtory transcription factors that bind to the DNA and decrease the rate of transcription
  - This is negative control
- Activators bind to the DNA and increase the rate of transcription
  - A form of tested **positive control**

- Molecules called **small effector molecules** play a role in transcriptional regulatory
  - They exert its effects via binding to a regulatory transcription factor and causing conformational change in the protein
  - Many cases, the effect of the conformational change determines whether or not the protein can bind to the DNA
- Above, we see a repressor in the (b) cateogry
  - When the small effect molecule is not in the cytoplasm, the repressor binds to the DNA and ihibits transcription
  - When a small effector molecule is there, it binds to the repressor and causes conformational change inhibiting the ability of the protein to bind to the DNA
  - Transcription can occur because the repressor is not able to bind to the DNA
- Repressors and activators repsonding to small effector molecules have two functional regions called domains
  - One domain is a site where protein binds to the DNA
  - The other is for the small effector molecule

# The *lac* Operon Contains Genes Encoding Proteins Involved in Lactose Metabolism
- In bacteria, 2 or more genes can be under transcriptional control of a single promoter
- This arrangement is an **operon**
  - The genes in the operon are a single unit, resulting in production of polycistronic mRNA, an mRNA encoding more than one protein
  - This gives the advantage of coordinating regulation of genes that encode proteins whose functions are used in common pathways
- The genome of E. coli carries an operon called the ***lac* operon** (lactose operson) containing the genes to metabolize lactose
- Figure below shows the organization of this operon found in E. coli chromosome, and the polycistronic mRNA transcribed from it
- The *lac operon* contains a promoter *lacP*, involved in the transcription of three protein-coding genes: *lacZ, lacY, and lacA*
  - *lacZ* gene encodes Beta-galactosidase, an enzyme breaking down lactose. It also converts a small percentage of lactose into allolactose, a structurally similar sugar, or lactose analogue. Allolactose is important in the regualtion of the *lac* operon
  - *lacY* encodes lactose permease, membrane protein needed to transport lactose into the cytoplasm of bacterium
  - *lacA* gene encodes galatoside transacetylase, covalently modifies lactose and lactose analogues by attaching an acetyl group (-COCH<sub/>3</sub>). Attachment of acetyl groups to nonmetabolizable lactose analogues prevents toxic buildup in the cytoplasm
