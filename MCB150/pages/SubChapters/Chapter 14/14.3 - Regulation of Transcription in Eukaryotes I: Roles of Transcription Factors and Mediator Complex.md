> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Explain the concept of combinatorial control
> 2. Describe how RNA polymerase and general transcription factors initiate transcription at the core promoter
> 3. Compare and contrast the roles of activators, coactivators, repressors, TFIID, and mediator complex in gene regulation
>
> - Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes shares similarities with bacteria
>   - e.g. Activator and repressor proteins are involved in regulating genes by influencing the ability for RNA polymerase to transcribe
>   - Many Eukaryotic genes are reguated by small effector molecules
> - Many differences still exist
>   - Eukaryotes are organized individually, not in operons
>   - Eukaryotes gene regulation tends to be more intricate (more complexities vs bacteria)
>   - Eukaryotes have much more complicated cell strctures with many more proteins and a vaareity of cell organelles
>   - Many eukaryotes are also multicellular and contain different cell types
>   - Animals and plants progress through developmental stages requiring changes in gene expression
> - Studying transcriptional regualtion let researchers find many eukaryotic genes be regulated by many factors
> - This is **combinatorial control**, as the combination of many factors determines the expression o fany given gene
> - Many factors contribute to combinatorial control
>   - One or more activators may stimulate the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription
>   - One or more reperssors may inhibit the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription
>   - The function of activators and repressers may be modulated in several ways, including binding to small effector molecules, protein-protein interactions, and covalent modifications
>   - Activators are necessary to alter chromatin structure in the region where a gene is located, making it easier for the gene to be recognized and transcribed by RNA polymerase
>   - DNA methylation inhibits transcription, preventing binding of an activator or recruiting protiens inhibiting transcription
>   - All 5 factors could play into regulating a single gene, or just 3-4
>   - Most cases, we just control the promoter


# Eukaryotic Protein-Coding Genes Have a Core Promoter and Regulatory Elements
- For eukaryotic protein-coding genes you need
  - Regulatory elements
  - TATA box
  - Transcriptional start site

- The TATA box and transcriptional start site form the **core promoter**
  - Transcriptional start sites is where DNA transcription actually begins
  - The TATA box is the 5`-TATAAA-3 prime sequence, +25bp upstream from a transcriptional site determines the precise starting point of transcription
  - Missing a TATA bo xmeans transcription may start at a variety of different locations
  - The core promoter, acting alone, results in low levels of transcription termed basal transcription
- Regulatory elements (or sequences) are DNA segments regualting eukaryotic genes
  - Regulatory elements are recognized by regulatory transcription factors that control RNA polymerase's ability to initiate transcription at the core promoter
  - Some known as **enhancers** play a role in RNA polymerase being able to begin transcirption, enhancing rate of transcription
  - If an enhancer doesn't function, most genes have a very low level of transcription
  - Other ones, known as **silencers**, prevent transcription of a given gene when expression is not needed
- A common location for regulatory elements is the region 50-100bp upstream from the start site
  - The location of regulatory elements greatyly varies among different eukaryotic genes
  - It could be downstream, like in introns or even 100,000bp away, but still exert super strong effects on RNA polymerase binding to the core promoter
  -  First discovered by Susumu Tonegawa and co, they find a gene palying a role in immunity that was from a region far away but still needed for high transcription levels
