> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Explain the concept of combinatorial control
> 2. Describe how RNA polymerase and general transcription factors initiate transcription at the core promoter
> 3. Compare and contrast the roles of activators, coactivators, repressors, TFIID, and mediator complex in gene regulation
>
> - Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes shares similarities with bacteria
>   - e.g. Activator and repressor proteins are involved in regulating genes by influencing the ability for RNA polymerase to transcribe
>   - Many Eukaryotic genes are reguated by small effector molecules
> - Many differences still exist
>   - Eukaryotes are organized individually, not in operons
>   - Eukaryotes gene regulation tends to be more intricate (more complexities vs bacteria)
>   - Eukaryotes have much more complicated cell strctures with many more proteins and a vaareity of cell organelles
>   - Many eukaryotes are also multicellular and contain different cell types
>   - Animals and plants progress through developmental stages requiring changes in gene expression
> - Studying transcriptional regualtion let researchers find many eukaryotic genes be regulated by many factors
> - This is **combinatorial control**, as the combination of many factors determines the expression o fany given gene
> - Many factors contribute to combinatorial control
>   - One or more activators may stimulate the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription
>   - One or more reperssors may inhibit the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription
>   - The function of activators and repressers may be modulated in several ways, including binding to small effector molecules, protein-protein interactions, and covalent modifications
>   - Activators are necessary to alter chromatin structure in the region where a gene is located, making it easier for the gene to be recognized and transcribed by RNA polymerase
>   - DNA methylation inhibits transcription, preventing binding of an activator or recruiting protiens inhibiting transcription
>   - All 5 factors could play into regulating a single gene, or just 3-4
>   - Most cases, we just control the promoter
