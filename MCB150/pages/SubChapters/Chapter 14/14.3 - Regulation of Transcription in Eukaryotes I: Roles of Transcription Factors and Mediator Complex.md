> - Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes shares similarities with bacteria
>   - e.g. Activator and repressor proteins are involved in regulating genes by influencing the ability for RNA polymerase to transcribe
>   - Many Eukaryotic genes are reguated by small effector molecules
> - Many differences still exist
>   - Eukaryotes are organized individually, not in operons
>   - Eukaryotes gene regulation tends to be more intricate (more complexities vs bacteria)
>   - Eukaryotes have much more complicated cell strctures with many more proteins and a vaareity of cell organelles
>   - Many eukaryotes are also multicellular and contain different cell types
>   - Animals and plants progress through developmental stages requiring changes in gene expression
> - Studying transcriptional regualtion let researchers find many eukaryotic genes be regulated by many factors
> - This is **combinatorial control**, as the combination of many factors determines the expression o fany given gene
> - Many factors contribute to combinatorial control
>   - One or more activators may stimulate the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription
>   - One or more reperssors may inhibit the ability of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription
>   - The function of activators and repressers may be modulated in several ways, including binding to small effector molecules, protein-protein interactions, and covalent modifications
>   - Activators are necessary to alter chromatin structure in the region where a gene is located, making it easier for the gene to be recognized and transcribed by RNA polymerase
>   - DNA methylation inhibits transcription, preventing binding of an activator or recruiting protiens inhibiting transcription
>   - All 5 factors could play into regulating a single gene, or just 3-4
>   - Most cases, we just control the promoter


# Eukaryotic Protein-Coding Genes Have a Core Promoter and Regulatory Elements
- For eukaryotic protein-coding genes you need
  - Regulatory elements
  - TATA box
  - Transcriptional start site

- The TATA box and transcriptional start site form the **core promoter**
  - Transcriptional start sites is where DNA transcription actually begins
  - The TATA box is the 5`-TATAAA-3 prime sequence, +25bp upstream from a transcriptional site determines the precise starting point of transcription
  - Missing a TATA bo xmeans transcription may start at a variety of different locations
  - The core promoter, acting alone, results in low levels of transcription termed basal transcription
- Regulatory elements (or sequences) are DNA segments regualting eukaryotic genes
  - Regulatory elements are recognized by regulatory transcription factors that control RNA polymerase's ability to initiate transcription at the core promoter
  - Some known as **enhancers** play a role in RNA polymerase being able to begin transcirption, enhancing rate of transcription
  - If an enhancer doesn't function, most genes have a very low level of transcription
  - Other ones, known as **silencers**, prevent transcription of a given gene when expression is not needed
- A common location for regulatory elements is the region 50-100bp upstream from the start site
  - The location of regulatory elements greatyly varies among different eukaryotic genes
  - It could be downstream, like in introns or even 100,000bp away, but still exert super strong effects on RNA polymerase binding to the core promoter
  -  First discovered by Susumu Tonegawa and co, they find a gene palying a role in immunity that was from a region far away but still needed for high transcription levels

# RNA Polymerase II, General Transcription Factors, and Mediator Complex Are Needed to Transcribe Eukaryotic Protein-Coding Genes
- Three forms of RNA polymerase are found, I, II, and III all in eukaryotes
  - II transcribes protein-coding genes
  - 3 different protiens initiate transcription at the core promoter of protein-coding genes
  - RNA polymerase II, 5 different proteins called General Transcription Factors, and a large group of proteins called a mediator complex
- RNA polymerase II and GTFs come together at the TATA box of the core promoter so transcription can be initiated
  - Series of interactions between proteins let RNA polymerase II bind to the DNA and begin transcription process
  - RNA polymerase II, GTFs at the TATA box is the preinitiation complex

- Another component needed for transcription in eukaryotes is a group of proteins called the mediator complex
  - Made of proteins binding to each other to form an elliptically shaped complex that partially wraps around RNA polymerase II and GTFs
  - Mediator complex mediates interactions of the preinitiation complex and regulatory transcription factors like activators or repressor taht bind to enhancers or silencers
  - The mediator complex controls the rate RNA polymerase begins to transcribe RNA at the transcriptional start site

# Activators and Repressors May Influence the Function of GTFs or Mediator Complex
- Activators and Repressors bind to enhancers or silences, respectively, and regulate rate of transcription of genes
- The commonly regulate RNA polymerase II by binding to GTFs or the mediator complex

## *Affecting the Function of GTFs*
- Shown below, some activators bind to the enhancer and influence the fucntions of GTFs
  - Activator may improve the ability of GTF called transcription factor II D (TFIID) to initiate transcription
  - TFIID recognizes the TATA box and assembles things
  - Activators may recruit TFIID to the TATA box, promoting assembly of GTFs and RNA polymerase II into the preinitiation complex

- In contrast, repressors bind to a silencer and inhibit TFIID function
  - Certain repressors exert their effects via binding to TFIID to TATA box or inhibiting the ability of TFIID to assemble other GTFs and RNA polymerase II at the core promoter

## *Affecting the Function of Mediator Complex*
- Below, an activator also interacts with a coactivator, a protein increasing rate of transcription but not directly to the DNA itself
  - The activator-coactivator complex stimulates the function of mediator complex, causing RNA polymerase II to proceed to the elongation phase of transcription more quickly
  - shown below, the activator-coactivator complex binds to a site relatively far away from the core promoter
  - A loop forms in the DNA for the complex to bind to the mediator complex

- Repressors have the opposite effect shown above
  - Repressors inhibiting the mediator complex means RNA polymerase II cannot advance to the elongation stage
- A third way to regulate transcription is by recruiting proteins affecting chromatin structure in the promoter region, covered in the next section
