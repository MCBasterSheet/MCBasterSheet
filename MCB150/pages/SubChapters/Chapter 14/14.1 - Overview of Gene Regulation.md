> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Identify ways organisms benefit from gene regulation
> 2. Identify where gene regulation can occur during the process of gene expression in bacteria and eukaryotes
>
> How does gene regulation benefit organisms? Energy conservaiton, proper expression in cell types and right stage of development, and many more. We will see a few examples illustrating the important consequences of gene regulation.

# Bacteria Regulate Genes in Response to Changes in Their Environment
- E. coli uses many types of sugar as a food source, increasing chances of survival
- It can use lactose, and the genome of E. coli carreis the code for proteins enabling the bacterium to metabolize lactose
- Below, we see the effects of lactose on the regulation of those genes
  - To use lactose, E. coli needs a transporter, a lactose permease, facilitating the uptake of lactose into the cell
  - It also needs enzyme Beta-galactosidase, catalyzing the breakdown of lactose
  - No lactose in the environment, little protiens are made
  - Many lactose, bacterium makes more proteins enabling more lactose to be used from the environment

- Soon all lactose is used up, and the genes encoding th eproteins shut off and most proteins are degraded
- The amino acids then are reused to make proteins in need
- Gene regulation conserves energy here to ensure lactose utilization exists only when lactose is present

# Eukaryotic Gene Regulation Produces Different Cell Types in a Single Organism
- **Cell Differentiation**, how cells become specialized into particular types with distinctive structures and functions
  - Humans muscles, neurons, etc.
- Below shows migrographs of many cells, and they are different as hell
  - Muscle cells, contraction, neurons cell signaling, skin cells are a protective outer layer

- Gene regulation is responsible for producing different types of cells within a multicellular organism
- Above, all three have the same genome, but their proteome differs
  - Certain proteins are in particular cell types but not in others
  - Or the relative amounts of proteins are different
  - Amount of protein depends on many factors, like how strong the gene is and how much protein is synthesized from mRNA

# Eukaryotic Gene Regulation Enables Multicellular Organisms to Proceed Through Developmental Stages
- Certain genes happen at certain stages of development, but not others
- E.g. Mammals
  - Early development is in the uterus, and following fertilization, we have an 8 week embryonic phase
  - Major limb growth happens here
  - The fetal stage happens from 8 weeks to birth (41 weeks) with only continued refinement
- The Oxygen demands of a rapidly growing embryo and fetus are also quite different compared to the mother
  - Gene regulation plays a big role in making sure the embryo and fetus gets the right amount of oxygen
  - Hemoglobin is a protein delivering oxygen to the cells of a mammal's body, composed of 4 globin polypeptides, 2 from one globin genes, 2 from another
- The Genomes of mammals carry several genes encoding slightly different globin polypeptides
  - The embryonic stage of development has zeta and epsilon globin
  - The fetal stage has only alpha and gamma globin
  - Birth ahs no gamma globin, and Beta globin is turned on
