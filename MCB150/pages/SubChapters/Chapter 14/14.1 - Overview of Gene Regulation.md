> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Identify ways organisms benefit from gene regulation
> 2. Identify where gene regulation can occur during the process of gene expression in bacteria and eukaryotes
>
> How does gene regulation benefit organisms? Energy conservaiton, proper expression in cell types and right stage of development, and many more. We will see a few examples illustrating the important consequences of gene regulation.

# Bacteria Regulate Genes in Response to Changes in Their Environment
- E. coli uses many types of sugar as a food source, increasing chances of survival
- It can use lactose, and the genome of E. coli carreis the code for proteins enabling the bacterium to metabolize lactose
- Below, we see the effects of lactose on the regulation of those genes
  - To use lactose, E. coli needs a transporter, a lactose permease, facilitating the uptake of lactose into the cell
  - It also needs enzyme Beta-galactosidase, catalyzing the breakdown of lactose
  - No lactose in the environment, little protiens are made
  - Many lactose, bacterium makes more proteins enabling more lactose to be used from the environment

- Soon all lactose is used up, and the genes encoding th eproteins shut off and most proteins are degraded
- The amino acids then are reused to make proteins in need
- Gene regulation conserves energy here to ensure lactose utilization exists only when lactose is present

# Eukaryotic Gene Regulation Produces Different Cell Types in a Single Organism
- **Cell Differentiation**, how cells become specialized into particular types with distinctive structures and functions
  - Humans muscles, neurons, etc.
- Below shows migrographs of many cells, and they are different as hell
  - Muscle cells, contraction, neurons cell signaling, skin cells are a protective outer layer

- Gene regulation is responsible for producing different types of cells within a multicellular organism
- Above, all three have the same genome, but their proteome differs
  - Certain proteins are in particular cell types but not in others
  - Or the relative amounts of proteins are different
  - Amount of protein depends on many factors, like how strong the gene is and how much protein is synthesized from mRNA

# Eukaryotic Gene Regulation Enables Multicellular Organisms to Proceed Through Developmental Stages
- Certain genes happen at certain stages of development, but not others
- E.g. Mammals
  - Early development is in the uterus, and following fertilization, we have an 8 week embryonic phase
  - Major limb growth happens here
  - The fetal stage happens from 8 weeks to birth (41 weeks) with only continued refinement
- The Oxygen demands of a rapidly growing embryo and fetus are also quite different compared to the mother
  - Gene regulation plays a big role in making sure the embryo and fetus gets the right amount of oxygen
  - Hemoglobin is a protein delivering oxygen to the cells of a mammal's body, composed of 4 globin polypeptides, 2 from one globin genes, 2 from another
- The Genomes of mammals carry several genes encoding slightly different globin polypeptides
  - The embryonic stage of development has zeta and epsilon globin
  - The fetal stage has only alpha and gamma globin
  - Birth ahs no gamma globin, and Beta globin is turned on

- Embryos and fetus  acquire oxygen via their mother's bloodstream as they have higer affinity hemoglbin
  - They literally suck the oxygen from your mother's blodostream and use it as their own
  - Across the placenta, we find gene regulation letting a mammal develop inside th emother's body even without breathing
  - Gene regulation lets correct hemoglobin production at the right time

# Gene Regulation Occurs at Different Points in the Process from DNA to Protein
- Gene regulation have an dramatic ability to respond to environmental changes, cell production, and advancement through development
- For protein-coding genes, regulation of gene expression can occur at any steps in the process making a functional protein
- Bacteria, gene regulation commonly occurs at the level of transcription, meaning that bacteria regulation how much mRNA is made from genes
  - A gene turned off means very little mRNA is made (turned on = mRNA made)
  - Transcription is the first step in gene expression, transcriptional regulation is an efficient way to regulate genes as it avoids energy wastage when the gene is not needed
  - Another way for bacteria to regulate gene expression is controlling the ability of mRNA translation (Less common in bacteria)
  - Lastly, it can also be regulated at post-translational levels in which a protein's function is controlled after it is synthesized via translation

- Eukaryotes, gene regulation happens at many levels, including during transcription, RNA modification, translation and after translation of a protein is completed
  - Transcriptional regulation is a prominent form of gene regulation for eukaryotes
  - Eukaryotic genes are transcriptionally regulated in several different ways, some of which just don't happen in bacteria
  - RNA modification regulation and of the rate of translation of mRNAs is also common
  - Eukaryotic proteins are regulated in many ways, like cellular regulation and biochemical regulation (feedback inhibition)
