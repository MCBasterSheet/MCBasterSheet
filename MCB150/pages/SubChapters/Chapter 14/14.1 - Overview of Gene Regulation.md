> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Identify ways organisms benefit from gene regulation
> 2. Identify where gene regulation can occur during the process of gene expression in bacteria and eukaryotes
>
> How does gene regulation benefit organisms? Energy conservaiton, proper expression in cell types and right stage of development, and many more. We will see a few examples illustrating the important consequences of gene regulation.

# Bacteria Regulate Genes in Response to Changes in Their Environment
