>Nucleic Acids are organic macromolecules that account for only 2% of the weight of animals. But they are extremely important as they are your DNA
  
# Nucleotides are the Building Blocks of DNA and RNA
- The two classes of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid.
	- DNA stores genetic information coded into the sequence of their building blocks
	- RNA molecules are involved in decoding this information into instruments for linking a specific sequence of amino acids to form a polypeptide. The monomers in DNA must be arranged in a precise way so that the correct code can be read.
- DNA and RNA are polymers consisting of linear sequences of repeating monomers. Each monomer, knon as a nucleotide, has 3 components.
	- A phosphate group
	- A pentose (5 carbon) sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose)
	- A single or a double ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms known as a base
- A nucleotide of DNA is called a deoxyribonucleotide. One of RNA is a ribonucleotide. The nucleotides in DNA contains the 5 carbon sugar deoxyribose.
- Four different nucleotides are present in DNA, corresponding to the four different bases that can be linked.
	- Purines, adenine and guanine, have a fused double ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms
	- Pyrimidine bases cytosine and thymine have a single ring structure
    
# DNA is Composed of Two Strands of Nucleotides
- Nucleotides are covalently linked together to form strands of DNA
- The phosphates and sugar molecules form the backbone of a DNA strand, with the bases projecting from the backbone
- The carbon atoms of the sugar are numbered 1`` through 5 `
- The phosphate group links the 3` carbon of one nucleotide to the 5 carbon of the next.
	- A DNA molecule consists of two strands of nucleotides coiled around each other to form a double helix
	- 2 strands are held together by H-bonds between purine base in one strand and a pyrimidine base in an opposite strand
	- The ring structure of each base lies in a flat plane perpendicular to the sugar-phosphate backbone
		- Thus, the arrangement of bases is like steps on a spiral staircase
- Only certain bases can pair with one anohter due to locations of H-bonding groups in the four bases.
	- In a DNA molecule, A is to T and G is to C.
	- Two H-Bonds form between adenine and thymine and 3 between guanine and cytosine
- If we know the amount of one type of base in a DNA molecule, we can predict the relative amounts of each of the other three bases.
	- E.g. if DNA is 20% A it is 20%T and 30%G and C

# RNA Strands Have a Similar Structure to DNA Strands
- RNA is only different in a few aspects from DNA
- Like DNA, RNA consists of nuclotides covalently linked together.
- RNA usually consist of a single strand of nucleotides
- The sugar is a ribose though, not a deoxyribose.
- The pyrimidine Thymine is Uracil instead.
	- The three other bases are left untouched
