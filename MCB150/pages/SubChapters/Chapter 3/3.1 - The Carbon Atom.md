# The science of a Carbon-Containing Molecules is known as organic chemistry
- ## In the 19th century, originally Vitalism was the main belief that no one could possibly create an organic molecule as a vital life force was part of it
	- Turns out to be wrong. Friedrich Wohler found Urea and was experimenting with it to see the color, size, shape, and other characteristics of the urea crystals.
	- 1828, Wolher tried to syntehsize an inorganic molecule, ammonium cyanate with ammonia and cyanic acid. Then he found that he made urea.
		- No mysterious life force was needed to create this organic molecule
	- Other scientists like Hermann Kolbe proved this to work with acetic acid too.
	- They found that all these organic compounds had a carbon atom attached to other atoms
- ## Carbon Forms Four Covalent Bonds with Other Atoms
	- The key property of Carbon is its ability to form four covalent bonds with other atoms including Carbon atoms.
	- With only 4 valence electrons, it can commonly pair with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms and more
		- It forms single or double bonds with other carbons and with oxygen and nitrogen
		- Can also triple bond between carbons and nitrogen
   	- The variation in bonding of carbon with other atoms lets many organic compounds be formed with such few organic molecules
		- Carbon can be linear, ringlike, highly branched
	- Carbon and Hydrogen have similar electronegativities therefore carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are nonopolar
		- Molecules with lots of these are hydrocarbons, whihc are hydrophobic
	- If Carbon makes a polar bond, (oxygen or nitrogen) the resulting molecule has regions of partial negative and partial positive charges, therefore it is hydrophilic.
	- Carbon bonds are also stable at many temperatures related to life.
		- The atom is smaller than most other atoms. Carbon-carbon bonds thus are very short
		- This lets the bonds survive in icy poles to superheated vents

- ## Carbon Atoms Bond to Several Biologically Important Functional Groups
	- Most organic molecules and macromolecules contain functional groups
		- Atoms with characteristics chemical structures and properties
		- Each type of group exhibits the same chemical properties in all moelcules in which it occurs.
		- The amino groups (-NH_{2}) acts like a base.
			- It can bind to an H+ to become NH_{3}+ removing an H+ from the aqueous solution and raising the pH.
			- These are in proteins and other organic molecules
	- Some important ones listed:
		- Amino (NH2) Amino Acids which are weakly basic, polar, and forms part of peptide bonds
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Carbonyl (-CO) 
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Ketone (Steroid, Waxes, Proteins) Double bonded CO and a random molecule
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Aldehyde (-CHO) like the Ketone but with a Hydrogen Always
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Polar, highly reactive, forms hydrogen bonds.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Carboxyl (-COOH) found in Amino Acids, fatty acids, and are acidic and forms part of peptide bonds
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Hydroxyl (-OH) are in steroids, alcohol, carbohydrates, and some amino acids which are polar and forms hydrogen bonds with water
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Methyl (CH3) may be in DNA, proteins, and carbohydrates. Their main feat is being non-polar
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Phosphate(PO_{4}^{2-}) are in Nucleic Acids, ATP, and phospholipids. THey are polar, weakly acidic and negatively charged at typical pH of living organisms
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Sulfate (-SO_{4}-) may be attached to carbohydrates, in proteins, and are in lipids. They are polar, negatively charged at typical pH of livin organisms
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Sulfhydryl (-SH) are in proteins that contain the amino acid cysteine. They are polar and forms disulfide bridges in many proteins
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number

- Carbon Containing Molecules May Exist in Multiple Forms Called Isomers
	- Urea = Ammonium Cyanate but not really.
	- These molecules with the same formula but different structures and characteristic are called isomers.
	- We got structural isomers that have same atoms but different bonding relationships.
		- This is urea and ammonium cyanate
	- We also got Stereoisomers with identical bonding relationships but spatial position of their atoms differs
		- We got cis-trans isormers and enantiomers.
		- Cis-trans isomers have cis isomers having the Hydrogen atom at the same side. Whereas the trans hydrogen are across from each other
			- This is in C=C bonds
			- These motherfucks are very different in chemical properties from each other. Their stability and sensitivity to heat and light are the real differs
		- Another one is called the enantiomer which is  a pair of molecules that are mirror images.
			- This is like a pair of gloves but much more dire
			- Due to orientation, their ability to noncovalently bond to other molecules can be strikingly different.
			- E.g. Enzymes are molecules that catalyze the rates of many reactions. However, one enzyme that can recognize one enantiomer cannot recognize the other.
