- # 3.2: Synthesis and Breakdown of Organic Molecules and Macro Molecules
	- Many molecules are small for biochem. However, some are large with thousands or even millions of of atoms linked together.
	- Such large molecules are called monomers (meaning one part) and are known as polymers (meaning many parts)
	- When a polymer is being formed, two smaller molecules combine by a condensation reaction, which makes a larger organic molecule plus a water molecule
		- Also known as a dehydration reaction because a molecule of water is being removed when a monomer is added to a growing polymer
	- Large carbohydrates are broken down. The process used for it is hydrolysis because a molecule of water is being added back in
	- Diagram to show:

- # 3.3 Overview of the Four Major Classes of Organic Molecules Found in Living Cells
	- By analyzing the cells of many different species, researchers have determined that all forms of life have organic molecules and macromolecules that are in four broad categories: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids
	- Here is a Bullet point list about each one:
		- Carbohydrates:
			  The general Formula is C_{n}(H_{2}O)_{n} where n is a whole number
			  They are broken down to make ATP as an energy source. Larger carbs may play a structural role. Some also as molecular tags to allow recognition of specific cells and molecules
			  They can be in the form of Simple Sugars like glucose or larger polymers like glycogen or cellulose
		- Lipids:
			  Lipids are nonpolar molecules that are primarily composed of Carbon and Hydrogen, with some oxygen
			  Lipids are a key part of cell membranes and also function as hormones and energy storage. In animals, they are insulators and shock absorbers
			  Examples include phospholipids, estrogens, and testosterone
		- Proteins:
			  A polypeptide is a structural unit composed of linear sequence of amino acids. Could be just one or more of these polypeptides
			  Proteins play a key role in cell structure and does a lot. It can do gene expression and regulation, motor proteins, defense, cell-signaling, etc.
		- Nucleic Acids
			  A nucleic acid is a linear sequence of nucleotides. DNA is double stranded, RNA is single stranded (may have double stranded regions).
			  DNA stores genetic information in units called genes. RNA is made from DNA and provides access to that information
			  Examples are: DNA and RNA (what else?)
    

- # 3.4 - Carbohydrates
	- Carbohydrates are organic molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.
		- Aka Carbon-Containing compounds that are hydrated, with water.
		- Usually have a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl function group. However other groups like amino and carboxyl groups are also found.
		- Sugars are small carbohydrates and polysaccharides are large macromolecules
    
- ## Sugars are Small Carbohydrates That Usually Taste Sweet
	- Simplest are known as monosaccharides (from Greek, meaning simple sugars)
		- Most common types are either 5 carbon (pentoses) or six carbons (hexoses).
		- Important pentoses are ribose (C_{5}H_{10}O_{5}) and the closely related deoxyribose (C_{5}H_{10}O_{4}) in RNA and DNA
		- Most common hexose is glucose (C_{6}H_{10}O_{6}) a very water soluble monosaccharide that circulates through blood and fluids.
			- Broken down by enzymes to release thine energy
			- Then to ATP
	- The rings are made from the linear structure when the oxygen atom attached to carbon 5 forms a covalent bond with carbon 1. The hydrogen atoms and the hydroxyl groups may lie above or below the plane of the ring structure.
		- This ring structure is a predominant type of structure in all living organisms
		- In terms of rings, they can be both D- and L-glucose, enantiomers.
			- D-Glucose is in living cells and used by enzymes to synthesize polymers.
			- L-Glucose is rarely found. Binds poorly to the same enzymes.
		- Other types of isomers also exist by changing the relative positions of the hydrogen and hydroxyl groups attached to carbons in the sugar ring.
			- E.g. Glucose can be hydroxyl group at the number 1 carbon either above (beta form) or below (the alpha form) the plane of the ring.
			- If the hydroxyl group on carbon 4 is above the plane in stead of below, it'll be galactose.
	- They can also merge via dehydration reaction to make Disaccharides like sucore.
		- This bond formed between two sugar molecules by this dehydration reacton is called a glycosidic bond.
		- Other disacchrarides found in nature are maltose and lactose.
			- Maltose is alpha glucose and alpha glucose, while lactose is beta galactose to beta glucose

- ## Polysaccharaides Are Carbohydrate Polymers that include starch Glycogen and Cellulose
  
	>When many monosaccharides are linked together to form long polymers, the products are polysaccharides.
   
	- We got starch in plants, glycogen in animals. Both are thousands of alpha-d-glucose molecules in long chains differing only in the extent of branching along the chain.
		- In starch and glycogen the bonds between carbons 1 and 4 and carbons 1 and 6 are the ones that connect the two molecules.
    
	- The branching in glycogen makes it soluble in muscles because of how many hydrophilic hydroxyl side groups have water and can hydrogen bond to it
	- Meanwhile, starch is less branching, less soluble, and is the structure of a plant
    
	- Some polysaccharides like the above store energy.
		- Then they are hydrolyzed to make monosaccharides, which are broken down to produce ATP.
		- Starch and glycogen are just efficient at this stuff.
	- Others play the structural role
		- E.g. cellulose makes cell walls.
			- Cellulose is a polymer of Beta-D-Glucose with linear arrangements of carbon-carbon bonds and no branching.
			- Cellulose is a long chain of thousands of glucose monomers, and each one has an opposite orientation from its adjacent monomers.
			- The chains have hydrogen bonds with each other in a parallel pattern. These sheets are strong for the cell walls
			- The bond orientations in Beta-D-Glucose prevent cellulose from being hydrolyzed. The enzymes that break alpha-D-Glucose does not recognize the shape of cellulose.
				- This lets plants use starch and not break down cellulose.
				- Some organisms however have an enzyme to break this stuff down. Just not us
      
		- Another one is Chitin, a tough one too.
			- Creates external skeleton on insects and crustaceans as well as the cell walls of fungi.
			- The sugar monomers within chitin have nitrogen-containing groups
     
		- Glycosaminoglycans are large polysaccharides that play a structural role in animals.
			- They are in cartilage as the tough fibrous material in joints and other animal structures.
     
		- Peptidoglycan is another major one in bacterial cell walls.
			- It is made of polysaccharides that are cross-linked via peptide side chains.
