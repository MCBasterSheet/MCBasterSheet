- Proteins play critical roles in nearly all life Processes. The word protein comes from the greek word proteios (meaning first rank)
- Proteins account for about 50% of all organic material in a typical animal's body
- Amino Acids are the Building Blocks of Proteins
	- Proteins are composed of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and small amounts of other elements (notably sulfur)
	- The monomers are called amino acids
		- This is where the carbon atom (the alpha-carbon here) is linked to an amino group (-NH_{2}) and a carboxyl group (COOH).
		- The alpha-Carbon also is linked to a hydrogen atom and a side chain, designated with the letter R
		- Proteins are polymers of amino acids

	- When an amino acid is dissolved into water at pH = 7, the amino group accepts hydrogen ions and is positively charged, whereas the carboxyl group loses a hydrogen ion and is negatively charged.
		- The name amino acid was given to such molecules because they have an amino group and also a carboxyl group that acts as an acid
	- All Amino acids except glycine exist in more than one siomeric form, called the D and L forms, which are enantiomers.
		- Only L-amino acids are found in proteins.
		- D-amino acids are not found in most cells.
			- An exception is in the cell walls of certain bacteria, where D-amino acids may play a protective role against molecules secreted by the host organism they are living on

	- The 20 amino acids in proteins are distinguished by their side chains.
	- The amino acids are categorized by whether the side chains are nonpolar, polar and uncharged, polar and charged.
		- Structures of the side chains are critical features of protein structure and function
			- Arrangements and chemical features cause proteins to fold and adopt 3d shapes
			- Certain side cahins may be critical in protein function too.
				- E.g. Amino acid side chains found within the active sites of enzymes are important in catalyzing chemical reactions

- Polypeptides are Linear Sequences of Amino Acids
	- Amino acids are joined together by a dehydration reaction that links th carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another
		- The covalent bond between a carboxl and amino group is called a peptide bond.
		- When multiple amino acids are joined by the peptide bond, it is called a polypeptide
		- When two or more amino acids are linked together, one end of the resulting molecule has a free amino group
			- This end is the amino end, or N-terminus
		- The other end of the polypeptide, called the carboxyl end, or C-terminus, has a free carboxyl group.
			- Amino acids within a polypeptide are numbered from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.
	- The term polypeptide refers to a structural unit composed of linear sequence of amino acids.
	- A protein is a function unit composed of one or more polypeptides that have folded and twisted into a precise 3d shape.
		- Proteins also have carbohydrates or lipids (glycoproteins and lipoproteins) that are covalently attached to certain amino acids
		- These mods impart unique functions to such proteins

- Proteins Have a Hierarchy of Structure
	- Scientists describe protein structures at 4 progressive levels.
		- Primary
		- Secondary
		- Tertiary
		- Quaternary
		- Each higher level of strcture depends on the preceding levels
			- E.g. changing the primary structure may affect the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.
	- The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids.
		- The structure of the primary structure is determined by its genes
		- Genes carry the information for the production of polypeptides with specific amino acid sequences
		- Ribonuclease is composed of a relatively short polypeptide consisting of 124 amino acids. An Average polypeptide is about 300-500 amino acids in length, but some are few thousands long.
	- Secondary Structure
		- Comes because the laws of chemistry and physics causes the polypeptide to fold into a more compact structure.
		- Amino Acids can rotate around bonds within a polypeptide
		- These chains are flexible and can fold like a string of beads
		- Folding can be irregular, or certain regions ca have a repeating folding pattern called **Secondary Structure**
			- The two basic types of secondary structure are the alpha helix and the beta pleated sheet
			- In an alpha helix, the polypeptide backbone forms a repeating helical structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the length of the backbone
				- Hydrogen linked to a nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom that is double bonded to a carbon atom.
				- If hydrogen bonds occur at a regular interval along the backbone, the polypeptide backbone twists into a helix
			- In a Beta pleated sheet, regions of the polypeptide backbone lie parallel to each other.
				- Hydrogen bonds between a hydrogen linked to a nitrogen atom and a double bonded oxygen form between these adjacent, parallel regions.
					- When this occurs, the polypeptide backbone adopts a repeating zigzag, or pleated shape
		- The alpha helices and Beta pleated sheets are key determinants of a protein's characteristics.
			- E.g. Alpha helices in a certain proteins are composed primarily of nonpolar amino acids. Proteins containing stretches of nonpolar amino acids tend to anchor themselves into a lipid-rich environment, such as a cell's plasma membrane
			- This way, a protein who needs to be at a plasma membrane can be stuck there
			- Secondary structure also goes to the strength of some proteins that make keratin, silk webs, and collagen
		- Some regions along a polypeptide chain do not assume an Alpha helix or Beta pleasted sheet and do not have a secondary nature.
			- These regions are sometimes called coiled regions.
			- This is a misleading term as the shapes of random coiled regions are usually very specific and important for the proteins function
	- Tertiary Structure
		- As the secondary structure of a polypeptide becomes established due to particular primary structure, side chains of amino acids interact with each other.
		- The polypeptide folds and refolds upon itself to assume a 3d shape.
			- The tertiary structure is the 3d shape of a single polypeptide
			- Tertiary structures include all secondar structures plus any interactions involving amino acid side chains
		- Some proteins, like ribonuclease has the tertiary structure as the final structure.
		- But it can go further to the quaternary structure
	- Quaternary Structure
		- Most proteins are composed of 2+ polypeptides that adopt a tertiary structure and then assemble with each other.
			- The individual polypeptides are called protein subunits.
			- Can be identical polypeptides or even different
		- When proteins consist of 2+ polypeptides, they have a Quaternary structure
			- E.g. Hemoglobin.
			- Four protein subunits combine to form one hemoglobin protein
			- Each subunit can bind a single molecule of oxygen, therefore hemoglobin carries 4 molecules of oxygen in the blood

- Protein Structure is Determined by Several Factors
	- The amino acid sequences of polypeptides distinguish the structure of one protein from another.
		- As polypeptides are synthesized in a cell, they fold into secondary and tertiary structures, which finalize as Quaternary structures. Several factors influence this
			- Hydrogen Bonds: A lot of weak hydrogen bonds within a polypeptides and between polypeptides can create a strong force that folds the protein and stabilizes it. Important overall and for its tertiary and Quaternary structure
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Ionic Bonds and other polar Interactions: Some amino acid side chains are positively/negatively charged. Positive charged side chains may bind to negatively charged side chains via ionic bonds. 
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Similarly, uncharged polar side chains in a protein may bind to ionic amino acids. Ionic bonds and polar interactions are particularly important in tertiary and quaternary structure
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Hydrophobic Effect: Some amino acid side chains are nonpolar. As a protein folds, the nonpolar amino acids are in the center, minimizing water contact. Some proteins have stretches of nonpolar amino acids that anchor the proteins in the hydrophobic portion of membranes. 
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- PLAYS MAJOR ROLE IN TERTIARY AND QUATERNARY STRUCTURES
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- van der Waals Dispersion forces: Atoms within molecules have termporary weak attraction for each other when an optimal distance apart.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- These weak forces are van der Waals dispersion forces (see [[2.2 - Chemical  Bonds and Molecules]])
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- If they are too close, their electron cloud would repel each other.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- If too far apart, this force is just gone.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- It mildly contributes to the tertiary and quaternary structure
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Disulfide bridges: The side chain of the amino acid cystine has a sulfhydryl group (-SH) and it can react with a sulfhydryl group in another cysteine side chain and form a covalent bond.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- This results in a disulfide bridge or disulfide bond which links the two amino acid side chains together (-s-s-)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Disulfide bridges can occur within a polypeptide or between different polypeptides
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Though other forces are usually more important in protein folding, the covalent nature of disulfide bridges can help stabilize the structure of a protein
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Images that show each one:
				-
	- Some proteins need to bind to another protein to exist. Like 2+ proteins binding with one another
		- Such binding is super specific as a reuslt
		- protein-protein interactions are critically important in allowing cellular processes to occur in a series of defined stueps.
		- Also important in building complicated cellular structures that provide shape and organization to cells.
- Feature Investigation: Anfinsen Showed That the Primary Structure of Ribonuclease Determines Its Three-Dimensional Structure
	- Prioer to 1960s, no one clue how proteins assumed their 3d structures.
	- Scientists hypothesized that the folding required cellular factors or ribosomes somehow shape the proteins during synthesis
	- Thus American Christian Anfinsen said that amino acid sequence is the primary factor  that determines how proteins fold into their proper conformations.
	- He hypothesized that a protein spontaneously assumes its most stable conformation based on principles of chemistry and physics
		- To test it, Anfinsen studied ribonuclease, an enzyme that degrades RNA molcules
		- Biochemicsts already determined ribonuclease has 4 disulfide bridges between 8 cysteines
		- First he began with purified ribonuclease (no other cellular componenets being present)
		- Then he exposed it to to Beta-mercaptoethanol breaking S-S bonds.
			- Then to urea, which disrupts hydrogen and ionic bonds
			- This thus denatured the ribonuclease
		- The enzyme then lost all ability to degrade RNA. Therefore, he concluded it was denatured
		- The key step was when he removed urea and Beta-mercaptoethanol
			- Because these molecules are smaller than ribonuclease, removing them was accomplished via a size-exclusion chromatography column.
			- Then a solution of ribonuclease, Beta-mercaptoethanl, and urea was poured on top of a column of small beads and allowed to flow down the column to an open collection port at the bottom. The beads trapped the urea and B-mercaptoethanl but let the large ribonuclease to pass down and be collected.
		- After the removal, he let the ribonuclease sit for 20 hours and lo and behind, the activity of the ribonuclease was back on track.
		- This means that ribonuclease can refold inot its functional structure! (not all proteins)
			- Some proteins still need assistance from enzymes and other proteins to achieve proper folding
				- Even then, the experiment provided the evidence needed that the primary structure of a polypeptide is a key for the tertiary structure.
				- Got 1972 noble prize

- Core Concepts: Evolution:
	- Proteins Contain Functional Domains
		- By comparing the structures of many different proteins, researchers have determined many of them have a modular design. This means that portions within these proteins, known as domains, have distinct structures and functions.
		- These domains have been duplicated during evolution. The same domain is found in many proteins. A domain that is found in different proteins has the same three-dimensional tertiary structure in all o them and performs a characteristic function.
		- Nuclear receptors are a related protein. They regulate how certain genes are turned on. These types of proteins are involved in animal development, reproduction, metabolism, and homeostasis. Nuclear receptors contain four or more domains within their structure.
			- Ligand binding doman were found. These receptors are activated by a ligand, a molecule that binds to the receptor.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Slight differences let one bind estrogen and one bind testosterone
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Another domain is the DNA-binding domain that binds to DNA once the receptor is activated by its ligand. The DNA- binding domains of these two receptors are sufficiently similar to enable both of them to bind to DNA but dissimilar enough that they bind to different genes. 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Another domain is the nuclear localization domain. It facilitates the ovement of the protein into the cell nucleus, where the DNA is located.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Once the protein binds to DNA, a fourth domain, called the activation domain, activates the transcription of the target gene.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Overall, a nuclear receptor is a single protein with multiple domains, each with a unique function.
