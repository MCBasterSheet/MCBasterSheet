> Apoptosis is programmed cell death, a killing itself. It shrinks and is rounder, then it has an irregular extension and BLOWS UP.

- Cell Biologists discovered apoptosis plays many emportant roles
  - Embryonic development needs it to sculpt tissues and organs. Fingers on a hand need to be separated from the webbed surface via apoptosis
  - Apoptosis keeps the proper number of cells in tissues and organs
  - Programmed cell death also eliminates cells from viruses or just too worn out causing cancer
- Lot of human diseases though are related to irregularities in Apoptosis

# Feature Investigation: Kerr, Wyllie, and Currle Found That Hormones May Control Apoptosis
- Mammal examination, with the Kerr seeing liver tissue deprived of oxygen found that some cells just cell shrunk
- Wyllie, Currie also found it in adrenal glands, so they all came together to help
- They found that Adrenocorticotopic hormone increases cells in adrenal corten and prednisolone suppress the synthesis of ACTH making a decrease in cells of the cortex
- 2 days later, they got some samples, and they occasionally observed cell death via apoptosis
- They found in prednisolone rats, you have more apoptosis and found that it is stupid high. Seems like ACTH also prevents apoptosis

- They justfigured out tissues decrease their cell numbers through shrinkage and blebbing and they found that prednisolone decreases ACTH and promotes apoptosis

# Signal Transduction pathways Lead to Apoptosis
- Apoptosis involves activation of cell-signaling pathways, one being the **extrinsic pathways** starting with **death receptors** on the cell surface
- Binding of death receptors causes a pathway for apoptosis
- Below shows a simplified pathway, and we see a signaling molecule of a protein composed of 3 subnits: a trimeric protein
  - Trimeric signaling molecules are made for immune systems and recognize abnormal cells and target them for destruction

- Signaling molecules bind to 3 death receptors, aggregating into a trimer
  - A conformational change happens as a result exposing the domain on the death receptors as a death domain
  - Exposure of the death domain lets it bind to adaptors binding to an initiator procaspase
  - Death receptors + Adaptors + initiator procaspase is the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
- Once initiator procaspacse, inactive, is part of the DISC, it is converted by proteolytic cleavage to initiator caspase, still active
  - **Caspase** functions as a protease, and its activation leads to initiator caspase being released from teh DISC and the caspase is the initiator caspase as it initiates the activation of many other caspases in the cell
  - Other caspases are the executiion as they digest intracellular proteins to kill cells
- The executioner digests a lot of protein (intracellular ones) like cytoskeletal, nuclear laminal, and ones with DNA replication and repair.
  - The executioner caspases causes LOTS Of cellular changes and its activation of DNase chops the DNA in the cell into small fragments. This removes a lot of virally infected cell as it destroyes the viral genomes composed of DNA
- Another pathway is the intrinsic pathway, or the mitochondrial pathway, being stimulated from DNA damaged causing cancer
  - Mitochondria (a literally chad) released cytochrome c (complex 4's thing but NOT AT ALL) into the cytosol and it forms a complex with other proteins called an apoptosome.
  - Apoptosome initiates activation of caspases
