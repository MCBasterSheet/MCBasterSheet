> # Learning Goals
> 1. Explain 2 reasons for cell signaling: Environmental Changes and cell-to-cell communication
> 2. Compare and contrast 5 ways cell communicates with each other based on distance between them
> 3. Outline the 3 stage process of cell signaling
>
> - One example of signaling is melanin in humans in response to UV rays
> - Also got cells making signals influencing neighboring cells like plant cells influencing cell elongation to grow towards the light
> - Cell signaling is a two way street
> - This section considers why cells need signals, examining various forms of signaling based on distance between cells that communicate with each other, finishing with steps occuring when a cell is exposed to the signal and makes a response to it

# Cells Detect and Respond to Signals from their Environment and Other Cells
- But why do we have signaling?
## *Responding to Changes in the Environment*
