> 2. Compare and contrast 5 ways cell communicates with each other based on distance between them
> 3. Outline the 3 stage process of cell signaling

> - One example of signaling is melanin in humans in response to UV rays
> - Also got cells making signals influencing neighboring cells like plant cells influencing cell elongation to grow towards the light
> - Cell signaling is a two way street
> - This section considers why cells need signals, examining various forms of signaling based on distance between cells that communicate with each other, finishing with steps occuring when a cell is exposed to the signal and makes a response to it

# Cells Detect and Respond to Signals from their Environment and Other Cells
- But why do we have signaling?
## *Responding to Changes in the Environment*
- They need to change for a changing environment
- Changing temperatures, nutrients, water, and light or even a toxic chemical needs **cellular responses** to address this
- A harmless example is yeast being exposed to glucose in its environment
  - More glucose transporters is produced, and all is happy

## *Cell to Cell Communication*
- This is just cells sharing information, and happens in plants growing towards light
  - The Darwins found it to just be bending from the lower parts so it starts there
  - Later on, auxin, building up in the darker parts of a plant, causes cell elongation so it bends the shoot to the light more

# Cell-to-Cell Communication Can Occur Between Adjacent Cells and Between Cells That Are Long Distances Apart
- Mode of communication depends on distance between cells
- We see here how **signals are transferred between cells**, next chapter determines how the signals elicit a response

## *Direct Intercellular Signaling*
- If adjacent, cells may have contacts (cell junctions) letting them pass ions, signaling molecules, or other materials between the cytosol of one cell and the cytosol of the other
- Hearts have these to pass ions to coordinate beating

## *Contact Dependent Signaling*
- Some molecules bound to the surface of a cell provide signals to others also making contact
- One cell has a membrane bound signaling molecules recognized by a receptor on the surface of another cell
- This happens in the immune system, showing signals on foreign objects so antibodies can come

## *Autocrine Signaling*
- A cell secretes signaling molecules binding to receptors on its own cell surface and on surfaces of neighboring cells of the same type
- If cell density is high, concentration of autocrine signals is also high, and can be used to inhibit cell growth

## *Paracrine Signaling*
- A cell secretes a signaling molecule not affecting itself, but influences target cells close to it
- this is a short term effect so it can't be carried out to differing parts of the body
- This happens in nervous systems as you can easily have neurotransmitters trasmit a signal to an adjacent cell

## *Endocrine Signaling*
- Long distance, using hormones, lasting longer than auto or paracrine signaling
- Mammals have it in the blood, affecting nearly all cells in the body
- Plants have it in the vascular system moving through adjacent cells
  - These mf even have it in the air, where Ethylene accelerates fruit ripening
- Hormones being, in animals, a chemical signal that is produced in a gland or other structure and released into the blood or hemolymph, where it acts on distant target cells. In plants, a signaling molecule that is important in coordination of plant development or plant response to the environment.

# Cells Usually Respond to Signals via a Three-Stage Process
- Usually binding of a signaling molecule to a recepter activates a signal transduction pathway to a cellular response
- 3 stages, receptor activation, signal transduction, and a cellular response

## *Stage 1: Receptor Activation*
- Signaling molecule binds to the receptor of the target cell, causing conformational change in the receptor that activates its function
- Most cases the activated receptor initiates a response causing changes in a series of proteins collectively forming the signal transductino pathway

## *Stage 2: Signal Transduction*
- The initial signal is transduced into a different signal
- Carried out by a groups of proteins to make a **signal transduction pathway**, these proteins change up and produce an intracellular signaling molecule
- Some receptors are intracellular and don't activate this pathway. Some just directly do it

## *Stage 3: Cellular Response*
- 3 Category to respond to: Enzymes, structural proteins, and transcription Factors
  1. Many signaling molecules just mess with one or more enzymes
  2. Cells can respond by altering functions of structural protiens like movement of body cells
  3. Signaling molecules can also affect the function of transcription factors, proteins regulating transcription of genes. Some also affect gene expression
