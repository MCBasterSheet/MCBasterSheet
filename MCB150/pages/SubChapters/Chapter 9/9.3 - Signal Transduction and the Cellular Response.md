> # Learning Goals:
> 1. For Signaling Molecules binding to receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein-coupled receptors, describe the signal transduction pathways and how those pathways lead to a cellular reponse
> 2. Relate the function of second messengers to signal transduction pathways
> 3. List examples of second messengers and explain how they exert their effects
> 4. Explain how crosstalk among signal transduction pathways can affect the cellular response
>
> We now see how intracellular events enable cells to respond to signaling molecules binding to a cell surface receptor: signal transduction and a cellular response. Most cases, binding signaling molecules to the receptor stimulates a signal transduction pathway. We begin examining the pathway controlled by an enzyme linked receptor, then consider G-protein-coupled receptors
