> We now see how intracellular events enable cells to respond to signaling molecules binding to a cell surface receptor: signal transduction and a cellular response. Most cases, binding signaling molecules to the receptor stimulates a signal transduction pathway. We begin examining the pathway controlled by an enzyme linked receptor, then consider G-protein-coupled receptors

# Some Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Activate Signal Transduction Pathways Involving a Protein Kinase Cascade That Alters Gene Transcription
- **Receptor Tyrosine Kinases** are a catgeory of enzyme-linked receptors found in all animals and in chanoflagellates, protists related to animals
  - Not found in bacteria, archaea, or other eukaryotic species (Bacteria do have receptor histidine kinases, and all eukaryotes have receptor serine/threonine kinases)
  - The human genome has 60 different genes encoding receptor tyrosin kinases recognizing various signaling molecules like hormones
- Below shows a simplified signal transduction pathway for Epidermal Growth Factor
  - A **growth factor** is a signaling molecule promoting cell division
  - Multicellular organisms, like plants and animals produce a variety of different growth factors to coordinate cell division throughout the body
  - Vertebrate animals, EGF is screted from endocrine cells, from the bloodstream, binding to receptor tyrosine kinase on target cells called EGF receptors
  - EGF is responsible for stimulating epidermal cells, like skin cells to divide

- Following receptor activation, 3 parts of the signal transduction pathway are
  1. Relay proteins activating a protein kinase cascade
  2. The protein kinase cascade phosphorylates intracellular proteins like transcription factors
  3. The phosphorylated Transcription factors stimulate gene transcription

## *EGF Receptor Activation*
- For receptor activation to happen, 2 EGF receptor subunits need to bind to a molecule to EGF
- Binding EGF causes subunits to dimerize and phosphorylate each other one tyrosine in receptors, explaining receptor tyrosine kinases
- Once EGF receptors are activated, signal transduction pathway begins

## *Relay Proteins*
- Phosphorylated form of EGF receptor is first recognized by a relay protein of the signal transduction pathway called Grb
- This changes the conformation of Grb so it binds to another relay protein in the signal transduction pathway termed Sos, causing relay protein to undergo a conformational change
- Activation of Sos causes a third relay protein called Ras to release GDP and bind GTP
- GTP-bound Ras is the activate form

## *Protein Kinase Cascade*
- Relay Proteins activate a protein kinase cascade, sequential activation of three protein kinases
- Ras to Raf, then Raf phosphorylates Mek, then phosphorylates Erk
- One advantage of a protein kinase cascade is signal amplification, where each kinase phosphorylating multiple proteins creating a greater cellular response

## *Activation of Transcription Factors and the Cellular Response*
- The phosphorylated form of Erk enters the nucleus and phosphorylates transcription factors like Myc and Fos
- What is the cellular response?
  - Once Myc and Fos are phosphorylated, they stimulate transcription of genes encoding proteins promoting cell division
  - Creation of these proteins stimulates cell division
- Growth factors like EGF cause rapid increases in the expression of many genes in mammals, as many as 100
- Signal pathways also play a role in cancer as mutations here cause hyperactive cell division

# Second Messengers Such as Cyclic AMP Are Key Components of Many Signal Transduction Pathways
- Let's now see signal transduction pathways and cellular responses involving G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
- Extracellular signaling molecules binding to cell surface receptors are sometimes referred to as first messengers, who bind to receptors like GPCRs
- Many signal transduction pathways lead to production of second messengers, small molecules or ions relaying signals inside the cell
- The signals result in second messenger production acting quickly, with a short duration. Signaling occurs when a cell needs a quick and short cellular response

## *Production of cAMP*
- Mammalian and plant cells make several different types of G protein alpha subunits, one being **adenylyl cyclase**, an enzyme in the plasma membrane
- This stimulates adenylyl cyclase to synthesize cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP, or cAMP), an example of a second messenger

## *Signal Transduction Pathway Involving cAMP*
- Let's explore a signal transduction pathway where GPCR recognizes the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline)
- Produced in a stressful situation, Epinephrine promots cellular changes like increased ATP production to deal with danger
- First, it binds to the receptor and activates a G protein
  - The alpha subunit activates adenylyl cyclase, catalyzing production of cAMP from ATP
  - cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) made of 4 subunits: 2 catalytic subunits phosphorylating specific cellular proteins and 2 regulatory subunits inhibiting catalytic subunits bound to each other
  - cAMp binds to regulatory subunits of PKA, and the binding of cAMP separates the regulatory and catalytic subunits, letting each catalytic subunit be activate

## *Cellular Response via PKA*
- How does PKA activation lead to a cellular response?
- PKA phosphorylates specific cellular proteins like enzymes, structural proteins, or transcription factors
- Phosphorylation of enzymes and structural proteins influences the structure and function of the cell, and the phosphorylation of transcription factors leads to the synthesis of new proteins affecting cell structure and function
- Shown below, we see how sekeltal muscles respond to more epinephrine
  - When PKA is activate, it phosphorylates two enzymes: phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthase, both involved with metabolizing glycogen, a polymer of glucose
- When phosphrylaase kinase is phosphorylated, it is activated and phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates another enzyme in the cell called glycogen phosphorylase
- This enzyme causes glycogen breakdown by phosphorylating glucose subunits at the end of a glycogen polymer, releasing glucose-phosphate molecules from glycogen

Where n is the number of glucose units in the glycogen polymer

- When PKA phosphorylates glycogen synthase, the function of this enzyme is inhibited rather than activated
- Glycogen synthase makes glycogen, so cAMP prevents glycogen synthesis

- Taken together, epinephrine in skeletal muscle cells stimulate glycogen breakdown and inhibit glycogen synthesis, providing cells with more glucose molecules to break down ATP to AAAA RUN AWAY

## *Reversal of the Cellular Response*
- Second messengers is really short, so when the signaling molecule is no longer produced and the concentration falls, a larger percentage of receptors are not bound by ligands
- When a ligand is gone from GPCR, GPCR is deactivated and the alpha subunit hydrolyzes its GTP to GDP, and the alpha subunit and Beta/gamma dimer reassociates to form an inactive G protein
- The amount of cAMP decreases due to the action of an enzyme called phosphodiesterase, making cAMP to AMP

- As cAMP levels fall, the regulatory subunits of PKA release cAMP, so the regulatory and catalytic subunits reassociate, inhibiting PKA
- Finally, enzymes called protein phosphatases remove phosphate groups from proteins, reversing effects of PKA

# Main Advantages of Second Messengers Are Signal Amplification and Speed
- Sutherland detremined many hormones cause cAMP to form in cell types
- Since his discovery, production of second messengers like cAMP has had 2 important advantages: Signal Amplification and Speed

## *Signal Amplification
- Many cAMP molecules activate many PKA proteins, and PKA protein phosphorylates many target proteins in a cell that promote silimar responses

## *Speed*
- cAMP has speed
- Second messengers are small and water-soluble, so they go into the cytosol fast
- Bacskai studied serotonin in neurons, a neurotransmitter binding to GPCR
- low serotonin causes depression lol, and they found low serotonin leads to less camp but any serotonin leads to a lot of cAMP

# Crosstalk May Occur Between Different Signal Transduction Pathways
- Any particular cell has many different types of receptors and each type recognizes a specific signaling molecule
- If exposed to multiple signaling molecules at the same time, the cellular responses often depend on crosstalk, the phenomenon where one or more components in signal transduction pathway affects a different one
- In the simplified scenario, we got A,B,C recognizing X,Y,Z
  - 3 different cellular responses are possible, 1,2,3
  - Crosstalk occurs in two ways
    - Protein in the middle STP activates a protein in the pathway on the left
    - A protein in the pathway on the right inhibits a protein in the middle pathway
  - Below shows the cellular responses with the given combinations of X, Y, and Z
  - Crosstalk lets cells respond to hormones in several different ways
