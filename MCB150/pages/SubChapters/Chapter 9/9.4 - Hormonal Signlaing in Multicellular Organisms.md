> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Explain how the cellular response to a particular hormone can vary among different cell types
> 2. Describe how a cell's response to a hormone depends on the gene it expresses
>
> We have seen signaling molecules bind to particular types of receptors, activation of signal transduction pathways to make a cellular response
>
> Now we learn this type is due to hormone depending on the cell type, and each cell type responds its own way. The variation is determined by protein types, like receptors and signal transduction proteins that each cell type makes, determined by the genes expressed in that type of cell

# The Cellular Response to a Given Hormone Varies Among Different Cell Types
- Signaling molecules exert their effects on cells via signal transduction pathways controlling functions or synthesis of specific proteins
- Multicellular organisms have hormones able to coordinate cellular activities like epinephrine
- Epinephrine has differing effects throughout the body
  - Coffee also does something similar, inhibiting phosphodiesterase, coverting cAMP to AMP, removing cAMP once a signaling molecule, like epinephrine, is no longer present
  - When caffinated, cAMP persists for a longer period of time and proliongs the effects of signaling molecules like epinephrine so small amounts fuck with you more.

# Core Concept: Information
- **A Cells Reponse to Hormones and Other Signaling molecules Depend on the Genes it Expresses**
  -  Differential gene regular gives a cell its own unique proteome
  -  The set of proteins in a cell determines its ability to respond to signaling molecules
  -  Here are some examples as to why it can affect a cellular response
  1. A Cell may or may not express a receptor for a particular signaling molecule
  2. Different cell types have different cell surface receptors recognizing same signaling molecule
  3. Two+ receptors work the same way in different cells but have different affinities for the same signaling molecules
  4. The Expression of proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction pathways may vary in different cell types
  5. The Expression of proteins that are controlled by signal transduction pathways may vary in different cell types
