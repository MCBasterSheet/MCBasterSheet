# The Ends of Eukaryotic Pre-mRNAs are modified by the Addition of a 5` Cap and a 3 Prime Poly A Tail
- Mature mRNAs of eukaryotes have a modified form of guanine covalently attached to the 5` end, this is capping
- Capping happens when pre-mRNA is still being made by RNA polymerase, when the transcript is only 20-25 bp in length
- WHY?
  - The 7-methylguanosine structure, the 5` cap, is recognized by cap-binding proteins, neede for the proper exit of mRNAs from the nucleus
  - After an mRNA is in the cytosol, the cap structure helps prevent its degredation
  - The cap structure is recognized by cap-binding proteins enabling mRNA to bind to a ribosome in translation

- At the 3` end, most mature eukaryotic mRNAs have a string of adenine nucleotides, 100-200 nucleotides in length known as a ** Poly A Tail**
- The **poly A tail** is not encoded in the gene sequence, instead it is enzymatically added after a pre-mRNA has been completely transcribed
  - A long poly A tail aids in the export of mRNA from the nucleus
  - It stabilizes a eukaryotic mRNA so it can exist for a longer period of time in the cytosol
- New Research has found some bacterial mRNAs with poly A tails in them
- However the poly A tail causes the mRNA to be rapidly degraded

# Splicing Involves the Removal of Introns and the Linkage of Exons
- In the 70s, when experimental tools to study eukaryotic genes at the molecular level came out, the scientific community was suprised by the discovery of coding sequences within many eukaryotic protein-coding genes are separated by DNA sequences transcribed by not translated into a protein.

- The non translated sequences are introns
- Sequences contained in the mature mRNA are exons
- Exons are ___ex___ pressed regi ___ons___ because they contain the coding sequence for a polypeptide
- Introns are ___int___e___r___vening regi___ons___ that are not expressed as they are removed from the pre-mRNA
- Introns must undergo RNA splicing, or just Splicing to become mature mRNA
  - Introns are removed and exons are connected to each other
- Introns are found in many but not all eukaryotic genes
- Splicing is less frequent in unicellular eukaryotic species, but happens in a lot of complex eukaryotes
- Animals and plants have more than one intron
  - E.g. average human gene has 9 introns, and the sizes range from few dozen nucleotides to over 100,000
- Few bacterial Genes have been found to have introns, but are rare among bacterial and archaeal species
- Introns are removed from eukaryotic pre-mRNA via spliceosomes that are composed of several different snRNPs (SNURP!!!!!!)
  - snRNP contains samll nuclear RNA and a set of Proteins (fuck this acronym)
  - An intron in pre-mRNA is defined by a particular sequence within the intron termed the branch site and by two intron-exon boundaries, called the 5` splice site and the 3 prime splice site (picture below)
    - Specific snRNPs bind to specific sequence at these three locations
    - This binding causes the intron to loop outwards, bringing the two exons closer together
    - Then the 5` splicesite is cut and the 5 prime end of the intron becomes covalently attached to the branch site
    - In the final site, the 3` splice site is cut and the two exons are covalently attached to each other
    - Then the Intron is released and eventually degraded

- In the image above, steps 3 and 4 are catalyzed by an RNA component in one of the snRNPs
- An RNA molecule that catalyzes a chemical reaction is termed a **ribozyme**
  - In this case, the RNA portion of this snRNP is a ribozyme that cleaves the RNA at the exon-intron boundaries and connects the remaining exons
  - This is called metalloribozyme as Mg2+ is needed to carry out its catalytic action
- In some ways, the function of the spliceosome is regulated so the splicing of a given mRNA could occur in two+ ways
- This is **alternative splicing**, letting a single gene encode 2+ polypeptides with differences in their amino acid sequences
  - Alternative splicing lets compelx eukaryotic sequences use the same gene to make different proteins at different stages of development or in different cell types
  - This can increase the size of the proteome while minimizing genome size
- Introns can also occasionally occur in rRNA and tRNA molecules of certain species
  - These introns are not removed by spliceosome, instead tRNA is self-splicing, meaning RNA can catalyze the removal of its own introns
  - Portions of the RNA can act as a ribozyme to cleave the covalent bonds at the intron-exon boundaries and connect the exons together
