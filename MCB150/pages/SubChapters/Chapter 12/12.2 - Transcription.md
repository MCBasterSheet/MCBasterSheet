> DNA stores information. To express genes, the information must be accessed on the molecular level. Instead of directly accessing the DNA directly, they instead use RNA via transcription where DNA sequence is copied into a RNA sequence. Transcription doesn't alter the structure of DNA, so the same DNA can store as more RNA is being made. Here, we see the steps that genes take to be transcriptional units. We also see the differences Bacteria and Eukaryotes have here.

# At the Molecular Level, a Gene is Transcribed and Produces a Functional Product
> Gene: An organized unit of base sequences that enables a segment of DNA to be transcribed into RNA resulting in the formation of a functional product

- When protein-coding genes are transcribed, an mRNA is made that specifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide.
- After being made, the polypeptide becomes a function product, where one or more become a functional protein
- The mRNA is an intermediary in polypeptide synthesis,
- Most genes are protein-coding genes
- For some genes, the functional product is the RNA, a non-coding RNA that is never translated
- There are two important examples of non-coding RNA
  - Transfer RNA (tRNA) translates the language of mRNA into amino acids
  - Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms part of ribosomes, providing the site of translation
  - We cover more later in the chapter
- A gene is composed of specific base sequences organized in a way that allows DNA to be transcribed into RNA
  - The image below shows the organization of sequences in a protein-coding gene
  - The **Promoter** is a sequence of DNA that controls when are where transcription will begin
  - The **Terminator** specifies the end of transcription
  - Transcription occurs between the two areas, where DNA is transcribed into mRNA from the end of the promoter through the coding sequence to the terminator
  - This transcribed region is the information that specifies amino acid sequence of a polypeptide when mRNA is translated

- Other DNA sequences are involved in the regulation of transcription
- These **Regulatory Sequences** function as sites for binding regulatory proteins, discussed in Chapter 14
  - When regulatory proteins bind to a regulatory sequence, the rate of transcription is affected
  - Some enhance, some inhibit rate of transcription

# During Transcription, RNA Polymerase Uses a DNA Template to Make RNA

- Transcription got 3 stages
   1. Initiation
   2. Elongation
   3. Termination

# Initiation
- Initiation is the recognition step.
- Bacteria have a protein called a sigma factor that binds to RNA polymerase, an enzyme synthesizing strands of RNA
- Sigma factors recognize the base sequence of a promoter and binds there
- An example of the promoter sequence is described in the legend in the image above
- The role of sigma factors is to bind RNA polymerase to the promoter
  - The initiation stage is completed when the DNA strands are separated near the promoter to form an open complex that is 10-15 base pairs long

# Elongation
- RNA polymerase synthesizes the RNA transcript
- This is where the sigma factor is released and RNA polymerase slides along the DNA to maintain an open ocmplex as it goes
- The DNA used as a template in RNA synthesis is the template strand
- The opposide DNA strand is the coding strand
  - The coding strand has the same sequence of bases as the resulting mRNA, instead having uracil rather than thymine
  - It carries the information that codes for a polypeptide
- During enlongation, nucleotides bind to the template strand and are covalently connected in the 5` to 3 prime direction
- This is the AT/GC rule in DNA replication but with AU/GC instead
- Bacteria got a RNA synthesis rate of 40 nucleotides per second
- Behind the open complex, DNA rewinds back into a double helix

# Termination
- When RNA Polymerase reaches a terminator, the RNA transcript dissociates from the DNA. This is termination of transcription
- When multiple genes in a chromosome is transcribed, the template strand varies among the genes
- The image below shows three genes adjacent to each other in a chromosome
  - A and B are transcribed left to right where the bottom DNA is the template strand
  - Meanwhile C is transcribed right to left using the top DNA strand as a template strand
  - All three cases have RNA synthesis beginning at a promoter occuring int he 5` to 3 prime direction
  - The template strand is **always read in the 3` to 5 prime direction**

# Transcription in Eukaryotes Involves More Proteins
- The basic features of transcription are similar among all organisms
- The genes of all species have promoters and the transcription process occurs in the stages of initiation, elongation, and termination
- But Transcription in Eukaryotic genes need more protein components than transcribing bacterial genes
  - E.g. RNA polymerase I, II, and III are all found in eukaryotes
  - II is responsible for transcribing mRNA from eukaryotic protein-coding genes
  - I and III transcribe genes specifying non-coding RNAs like tRNA and rRNA
- Bacteria only got one RNA polymerase for all genes, but many bacterial species have more than one type of sigma factor to recognize different promoters
- Initiation is also more ocmplex
  - E. Coli only needs a sigma factor to recognize, while RNA polymerase II of eukaryotes need 5 transcription factors to initiate transcription
  - **Transcription Factors** are proteins that influence the ability for RNA polymerase to transcribe genes
  - Binding RNA Polymerase II to the promoter is an assembly process where RNA polymerase II and 5 transcription factors form a **preinitiation complex**, where the complex unwinds the DNA to initate transcription
