# The Genetic Code Specifies the Amino Acids Within a Polypeptide
- Ability of mRNA -> Amino Acid of a polypeptide relies on the genetic code
- The code is based on 3 nucleotide base sequences known as **codons**
- The genetic code has 64 different codons (4 codons ^ 3 base slots)
  - Each sequence of the 3 bases specifies a particular amino acid
  - E.g. the codon CCC specifies Proline, and GGC specifies Glycine.
- From analyzing basically every species you can think of, genetic code is universal. Only a few exceptions have been discovered

- 64 codons combinations, but 20 types of amino acids? This is because genetic code is said to be **degenerate** as more than one codon specifies the same amino acid
  - e.g. the codon GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG all code for glycine. Most of the time, it is the third codon being the degenerate/variable base

# During Translation, mRNA is Used to Make a Polypeptide with a Specific Amino Acid Sequence
- Check the image below for the:
  - Ribosomal-binding site: A site located near the 5` end of the mRNA and provides a location for the ribosome to bind to the mRNA
  - Start Codon: First codon used in translation, determines where translation begins. Start codon is AUG (methionine) and is a few nucleotides from the ribosomal-binding site.
    - Also defines the **reading frame** of an mRNA, the order in which codons are read during translation.
    - At the start codon, each adjacent codon is read as a group of 3 bases, a triplet, in the 5` to 3 prime direction
    - E.g.: The two mRNA sequences are their corresponding amino acid sequences

    - Sequence one is how the mRNA codons would be correctly translated into amino acids
    - The second sequence has an additional U, shifting the reading frame and changing the codons occuring in the 5` to 3 prime direction.
    - Now they all have a very different sequence of amino acids, therefore a small change in DNA and mRNA sequence has a profound change on the amino acid sequence; furthermore, with a reading frame that doesn't overlap, each base is found within a single codon
  - Coding Sequence: The region that begins with the start codon and specifies the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. A typical one being a few hundred Amino Acids in length. The coding sequence is a series of codons
  - Stop Codon: The last codon, signaling the end of translation. These codons are known as **termination codons** being UAA, UAG, and UGA. They **DO NOT** code for an amino acid

# DNA Stores Information, Whereas mRNA and tRNA Access That Information to Make Polypeptides
- The relationship of a DNA gene sequence, the mRNA transcribed from the gene, and the polypeptide sequence can all be found in the image below
- The template strand is used to make mRNA, the resulting mRNA strand also corresponds to the coding strand of DNA, except the U in mRNA instead of T in DNA.
- The 51 end of the mRNA contains an untranslated region (5` UTR) as does the 3 prime end (3 prime UTR)
- The middle portion contains a series of codons that actually specify the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide

- Translating between a nucleotide sequence of mRNA into an amino acid sequence needs recognition between mRNA and tRNA molecules
  - tRNA, a translator or intermediary between mRNA codon and an amino acid
- The **anticodon** is a three-base sequence in a tRNA  molecule that is complementary to a coon in mRNA. This complementarity  of the anticodon in the tRNA and the codon in an mRNA makes it bind to one another
- Furthermore, the anticodon in a tRNA corresponds to the amino acid that it carries
  - If the anitcodon in tRNA is 3`-AAG-5, the complementary is 5-UUC-3 codon
  - Since UUC refers to phenylalanine, then tRNA of AAG must have phenylalanine
- As seen at the bottom of the image above, the direction of polypeptide synthesis parallels the 5` to 3 prime orientation of mRNA
  - The first amino acid is the amino end, or N terminus due to the presence of a Nitrogen atom at the end, whereas the amino end has the amino group
  - Peptide bonds connect the amino acids together. They are covalent bonds of carboxyl groups of the previous amino acid and the amino group of the next one
  - The last amino acid in the completed polypeptide does not have another amino acid attached to its carboxyl group, and the last amino acid is located at the carboxyl end, the **C-terminus**
    - A carboxyl group is always found at this end of the polypeptide
   
> For your information, an anticodon of 3`-CAG-5prie is complementary to a codon with 5-GUC-3. This codon specifies Valine, and this tRNA just carry Valine


# Synthetic RNA Helped Researchers Decipher the Genetic Code
- 1960s, genetic code was determined by the collective efforts of several researchers, like Marshall nirenberg, Severo Ochoa, and Philip Leder
  - Prior to them, other scientists have found bacteria cells can be broken open and components from the cytoplasm can synthesize polypeptides if mRNA is still present
  - This mixture is called an **in vitro translation system**, or **cell-free translation system**
- Nirenberg and Ochoa made synthetic mRNA molecules using an enzyme that covalently connects nucleotides together
  - This synthetic mRNA lets them determine which amino acids are incorporated into polypeptides
    - E.g. Synthetic mRNA molecules having only adenine-containing molecules would create a polypeptide that only had lysine. Therefore, AAA codon specifies lysin
- Another method used to decipher the genetic code involved the chemical synthesis of short RNA molecules, covered below.

# Feature Investigation: Nirenberg and Leder Found that RNA Triplets Can Promote the Binding of tRNA to Ribosomes
- 1964, both of them found RNA molecules containing 3 nucleotides can cause a tRNA molecule to bind to a ribosome
  - Aka, an RNA triplet can act as a codon within an mRNA molecule
- To establish the relationship of triplet sequences and the specific amino acids, they made triplets with specific base sequences, e.g 5-CCC-3 triplets
- Triplets of these types were added to 20 different types, and each type had an in vitro translation system, containing ribosomes with tRNAs with amino acids attached to them
  - Each translation system had only one radiolabeled amino acid.
  - One had only proline radiolabeled, the second one had only serine labeled, and so on
- As shown in step 2 of the diagram, the triplets became bound to the ribosomes like mRNA is bound to ribosomes
- The tRNA with an anticodon complementary to the added triplet then bound to the triplet, already bound to a ribosome
  - E.g. When the triplet was 5-CCC-3, a tRNA with 3-GGG-5 anticodon became bound to the triplet/ribosome complex. This tRNA has proline
- To determine which tRNA has bound, they poured the contents through a filter trapping large ribosomes but not tRNAs that were not bound to ribosomes
  - If the tRNA carrying the radiolabeled amino acid was bound to the triplet/ribosome complex, radioactivity would be trapped onto the filter
  - A scintillation counter let researchers see how radioactive the filters are, and as only one amino acid was radiolabeled in each translation system, they could see which triplet corresponded to which amino acid
    - This example shown CCC correspond to proline, therefore the translation system with proline showed large amounts of radioactivity on the filter
- Therefore, by studying triplets with different sequences, Nirenberg and Leder found many codons of genetic code
