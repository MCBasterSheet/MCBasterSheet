# In Preparation for Cell Division, Eukaryotic Chromosomes Are Replication and Compacted to Produce Pairs Called Sister Chromatids
- How the fuck are chromosomes repliccated and sorted?
- Chapter 11 shown how we replicate DNA, and this image below us shows it at the chromosomal level
- Anyways, prior to DNA replication, the DNa of each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a linear double helix found in the nucleus and is not highly ocmpacted
  - When DNA is replicated, 2 copies of the original double helix are produced, and thes copies with proteins lie side by side and are termed sister chromatids
  - When a cell is ready to divide, the sister chromatids become highly compacted and readily visible under the microscope

This is a general diagram of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Advancement through the cell cycle requires the formation of activated cyclin/cdk complexes. Cells make different types of cyclin proteins, which are typically degraded after the cell has advanced to the next phase. Also, a few different types of cdks are made, depending on the species and cell type. The formation of activated cyclin/cdk complexes is regulated by checkpoint proteins.
</details>

- As shown in the image above (b section) the two sister chromatids are tightly associated at the region called the **centromere**
- Proteins called cohesin holds the sister chromatids together, and the centromere serves as an attachement site for a group of proteins called a kinetochore, structure needed for sorting chromosomes

# The Spindle Apparatus Organizes and Sorts Chromosomes During Cell Division
- **The Spindle Apparatus** organizes and sorts the chromosomes during cell division
- Composed of microtubules (go to [4.4 to learn more](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/pages/SubChapters/Chapter%204/4.4%20-%20The%20Cytosol.md))
  - In animal cells, microtubule growth and organization starts at two centrosomes, structures that are also referred to as microtubule-organizing centers (MTOC)
- A single centrosome Duiplicates during interphase, so when the cell enters mitosis, each centrosome defines a pole of the spindle apparatus, one within each of the future daughter cells
- The Centrosome in animal cells has a pair of centrioles, each one composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules, except they aren't really find in many other eukaryotic species as plants don't even need them

The spindle apparatus in animal cells is formed by the centrosomes, which produce three types of microtubules. The astral microtubules emanate away from the region between the poles. The polar microtubules project into the region between the two poles. The kinetochore microtubules are attached to the kinetochores of sister chromatids. Note: For simplicity, this diagram shows only one pair of homologous chromosomes. Eukaryotic species typically have multiple chromosomes per set.
</details>

- Each centrosome organizes the construction of the microtubules by rapidly polymerizing tubulin proteins
  - The three main types of spindle microtubules are termed **astral, polar, and kinetochore** microtubules

# The Transmission of Chromosomes Requires a Sorting process Known as Mitosis
- Mitosis is the sorting process for dividing one cell nucleus into two nuclei
- The Duplicated chromosomes are distributed so that each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome
- Mitosis was first observed microscopically in the 1870s by Wlather Flemming, coining the term as he was a greek nerd
  - mitos is thread
  - he found large transparent skin cells of salamander larvae as they were dividing and noticed chromosomes constructured of threats doubled in appearance along their length
  - These double threads divided and moved apart, one going to each of the two daughter nuclei
  - This mechnanism shows two daughter cells receiving an identical group of threats, the same as the number of threads in the mother cell

The top panels are fluorescence micrographs of a newt cell advancing through mitosis. The drawings below emphasize the sorting of the chromosomes, in which the diploid mother cell had six chromosomes (three in each set). At the start of mitosis, these have already replicated into 12 chromatids. The final result is two daughter cells, each containing six chromosomes
</details>

- The image above depicts the process of mitosis in an animal cell, though the process is quite similar in a plant cell
- Mitosis is a continuum of phases known as the **prophases, prometaphaes, metaphases, anaphases, and telophases**
- In the diagrams on the bottom of the image above (yeah fuck you), the OG cell has 6 different chromosomes, one set in red and the homologous set in blue
  - These different colors are intended to distinguish from maternal and paternal chromosomes

## *Interphase*
- Prior to mitosis, cells are in interphase, of G<sub/>1</sub>, S, and G<sub/>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle
- Chromosomes replicate in the S phase and are decondensed and found in the nucleus
- The nucleolus, making ribosomes into ribosomal subunits, is visible

## *Propahse*
- The start of mitosis has prophase, chromosome replicated to make 12 chromatids joined as 6 pairs in highly compacted structures visible by light microscope (refer to image above we got 46 chromatids and 23 pairs)
- The nuclear envelope begins to dissociate into small vesibcles, and the nucleolus is no longer visible

## *Prometaphase*
- The nuclear envelope completely fragments into small vesicles, and the spindle apparatus is fully formed
  - Once its fully dissociated, the spindle fibers can interact with the sister chromatids
- Centrosomes move apart and demarcate the two poles
- Sister chromatids attach to spindle apparatus by having the microtubules quickly form, able to be seen under a microscope growing out from the two poles
  - As it grows, the microtubules makes contact with a kinetochore, and is is captured and attached to the kinetochore
  - If it does NOT collide with the kinetochore, it depolymerizes and reattaches to the centrosome
  - This random process determines how sister chromatids are attached to  kinetochore microtubules
- The end of prometaphase has the two kinetochores on each pair attached to the kinetochore microtubules from opposite poles
- As the events occur, the sister chromatids go through jerky movements as they are tugged back and forth, between poles by the kintochore microtubules

## *Metaphase*
- Once the sister chromatids are aligned in a row along the metaphase plate, halfway between the poles of the spindle apparatus, they are in the metaphase of mitosis so the chromatids can be equally distributed into two daughter cells

## *Anaphase*
- Connections between pairs of sister chromatids break, and now as individual chromosomes, it linked to only one of two poles by one or more kinetochore microtubules
- As anaphase continues, kinetochore microtubules shorten, pulling the crhomosomes into the pole which they attach to
- Two poles move futher away from one another due to overlapping polar microtubules lengthening and pushing each other

## *Telophase*
- Chromosmes reached their poles and decondense
- The nuclear envelope reforms into two separate nuclei

## *Cytokinesis*
- Mitosis quickly follows cytokinesis, segregation of two nuclei into daughter cells
- Cytokinesis varies a lot between plant and animal cells
  - Cytokinesis in animals have a cleavage furrow, a draw string constricting the cell to separate them
  - Plants have vesicles from the golgi apparatus move along microtubules to the center of the cell and combine to form a cell palte, a cell wall between the two daughter cells

- Cytoskeletal filaments play a key role in cytokinesis, microtuybules positiioning the cleavage plane in animal cells and making cell plates in plant cells
- In animals, actin is involved in the formation of the cleavage furrow
- The results should have two identical daughter cells unless if something fucks up (e.g. mutation)

# Core Concept: Evolution
- **Mitosis In Eukaryotes Evolved from Binary Fission Occuring in Prokaryotes**
  - Mitosis lets  eukaryotic cells properly sort chromosomes during cell division
  - Comparing division in eukaryotes and prokaryotes let researchers devise how one formed from the other
- **Binary Fission in Bacterial Cells**
  - Bacterial cells divide by binary fission, so after chromosome replication, each copy of the bacterial chromosome anchors to the plasma membrane
  - Proteins called FtsZ form a ring at the site where the mother cell divides into two daughter cells
- **Dinalfalgellates**
  - Protists have nuclear division much simpler than in animal and plant cells
  - After replication of the chromosomes, the chromosomes become attached to the nuclear envelope
  - The envelope down't break apart, and microtubules are formed in the cytosol to pass through tunnels in the nuclear envelope
  - Then the nucleus divides by a process resembling binary fission
- **Diatoms and Some Yeasts**
  - Diatoms (protist) and yeast (fungus) microtubule form within the nucleus
  - Kinetochore microtubules attach to chromosomes and facilitate their sorting and other microtubules promote separation of the nucleus into two separate nuclei
  - The nuclear envelope does not break apart
- **Complex Eukaryotes**
  - This breaks the nuclear envelope and forms the spindle apparatus
  - After sorting the chromosomes, the nuclear envelope reforms
  - The FtsZ proteins in bacteria are related to tubulin, big component in eukaryotic microtubules
    - Filemtns of FtsZ proteins assemble into a Z-Ring
    - Eukaryotic cells, homologous protein, tubulin, forms linear microtubules and acquired additional roles in cell division
    - This inclues division of the cell nucleus and sorting of the chromosomes
    - Relationship of tubulin to FtsZ is an example of descent without modification (IB150 bs lol)
