> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Explain how the replication of euakryotic chromosomes produces sister chromatids
> 2. Describe the structure and functions of the spindle apparatus
> 3. Outline the key events that occur during the phases of mitosis
>    
> - Now we see how cell division and its relationship to chromosome replication and sorting happens
> - During **mitotic cell division**, a cell divides into 2 new cells genetically identical to the mother cell
> - Mitotic cell division involves mitosis, dividing one nucleus into two nuclei, then cytokinesis, where the mother cell divides into two daughter cells
> - But why mitotic cell division? **Asexual Reproduction**, genetically identical offspring made from a single parent
> - Another reason is the maitenance of multicullularity like in plants, animals, and most fungi coming from a single cell dividing into a multicellular organism
> - This section covers mitotic cell divsion in replication, organization, and sorting of chromosomes and how a single cell is separated into tewo daughter cells by cytokinesis

# In Preparation for Cell Division, Eukaryotic Chromosomes Are Replication and Compacted to Produce Pairs Called Sister Chromatids
- How the fuck are chromosomes repliccated and sorted?
- Chapter 11 shown how we replicate DNA, and this image below us shows it at the chromosomal level
- Anyways, prior to DNA replication, the DNa of each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a linear double helix found in the nucleus and is not highly ocmpacted
  - When DNA is replicated, 2 copies of the original double helix are produced, and thes copies with proteins lie side by side and are termed sister chromatids
  - When a cell is ready to divide, the sister chromatids become highly compacted and readily visible under the microscope

  <summary>Flavor Text</summary>
This is a general diagram of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Advancement through the cell cycle requires the formation of activated cyclin/cdk complexes. Cells make different types of cyclin proteins, which are typically degraded after the cell has advanced to the next phase. Also, a few different types of cdks are made, depending on the species and cell type. The formation of activated cyclin/cdk complexes is regulated by checkpoint proteins.

- As shown in the image above (b section) the two sister chromatids are tightly associated at the region called the **centromere**
- Proteins called cohesin holds the sister chromatids together, and the centromere serves as an attachement site for a group of proteins called a kinetochore, structure needed for sorting chromosomes

# The Spindle Apparatus Organizes and Sorts Chromosomes During Cell Division
- **The Spindle Apparatus** organizes and sorts the chromosomes during cell division
- Composed of microtubules (go to [4.4 to learn more](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/pages/SubChapters/Chapter%204/4.4%20-%20The%20Cytosol.md))
  - In animal cells, microtubule growth and organization starts at two centrosomes, structures that are also referred to as microtubule-organizing centers (MTOC)
- A single centrosome Duiplicates during interphase, so when the cell enters mitosis, each centrosome defines a pole of the spindle apparatus, one within each of the future daughter cells
- The Centrosome in animal cells has a pair of centrioles, each one composed of nine sets of triplet microtubules, except they aren't really find in many other eukaryotic species as plants don't even need them
