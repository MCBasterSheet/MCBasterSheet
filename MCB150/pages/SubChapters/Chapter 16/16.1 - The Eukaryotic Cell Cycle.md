> 1. Describe the Features of chromosomes, and explain how sets of chromosomes are examined microscopically
> 2. Outline the phases of Eukaryotic cell cycle
> 3. Explain how cyclins and cdks work together to advance a cell through the eukaryotic cell cycle
>
> - New cells come from division of pre-existing cells
> - *Omnis cellula e cellula*, or if you speak english, Every cell originates from another cell, was proposd by Rudolf Virchow a German biologist
> - This crap is old, and the first living organism just came about from this
> - Anyways, a **Cell Cycle** comes from a series of events leading to cell divsion
>   - Highly regulated so it happens at the right time
>   - Bacterial cells do BINARY FISSION NOT MITOSIS
>   - Eukaryotics have a complex cell cycle as we have more chromosomes to be sorted
> - This section examines phases of the eukaryotic cell cyle and see how it is controlled by proteins carefully monitoring the division to ensure accuracy
> - First, we need to see some general features of chromosomes in eukaryotic species

# Chromosomes Are Inherited in Sets and Occur in Homologous Pairs
- In the textbook, we see how cells are obtained from a sample of human blood, specifically chromosomes in the leukocytes (white blood cells) were examined
- They were treated with drugs to stimulate division then centrifuged to concentrate them into a pellet, mixed with a hypotonic solution to make the cells swell
- The expansion of the cells caused the chromosomes to spread out from each other, making it easiser to see individiual chromosome
- Then another centriguation happened and they were treated with a ixative which chemically fixed them in plac eso the chromosomes could no longer move around
- Dying happen, like a Giemsa strain that binds to chromosomes and stains them, giving them a banding pattern, enhancing contrast, and their ability to be uniquely identified

- The cells were placed on a slide and viewed with a light microscope in this example, but in a cytogenetics laboratory, microscopes are equipped with an electronic camera to photograph the chromosomes so they can organize the chromosomes from lartgest to smallest
- A photographic representation of a chromosome is called a **karyotype**, which shows the number, size, and form of chromosomes within an actively dividing cell
  - These chromosomes in actively dividing cells have also already replicated, so the two copies joined together are **sister chromatids**

## *Sets of Chromosomes*
- Studying the karyotypes of species let scientists known that eukaryotic chromosomes occur in sets with different types of chromosomes
  - E.g. 1 set of human chromosomes is 23
- The chromosomes are numbered according to size, largest chromosomes with smaller numbers (1,2 large but 21, 22 small)
- This numbering does not occur for **sex chromosomes** which determine the sex of an individual
  - Designated with the letters X and Y, and males being XY and females being XX
- Chromosomes not being sex chromosomes are called **autosomes**, with us having 22 different types of them
- Another feature of chromosomes found is that that many eukaryotic species carry two sets of chromosomes
  - Humans have 46 total chromosomes due to this trait, each cell having something from the mother and the father
  - When the cells of an organism carries two sets, they are a **diploid**
  - The letter n is used to represent a set of chromosomes, so dipoid are 2n as they have two sets
  - Humans are 2n and n=2
  - Most human cells are diploid with the exeption being gametes in sperm and egg cells
  - Gametes are **haploid**, or 1n, meaning they contain one set of chromosomes
## *Homologous Pairs of Chromosomes*
- If an organism is diploid, the members of a pair of chromosomes are called **homologs**
- **homology** refers to any similarity due to a common ancestry
- Pairs of homologous chromosomes are not usaully identical because over many generations, they have accumulated a lot of genetic changes to make them distinct
- However, they are stupid similar, each being nearly identical in size and super similar composition of genetic material
- A gene found on one copy is usually found on the homolog, but because one homolog is reeived from each parent, the two homologs may vary in the way that a gene affects an organism's traits
- lets see *Herc2*
  - Determining eye color, it is found on chromosome 15
  - One copy may carry eye color genes for brown eyes, whilst the homolog carries for blue eyes
- The DNA sequences on homolog chromosomes are very similar, most cases having the bases on one homolog differing by less than 1% from the sequence on the other homolog
  - E.g. Chromie 1 from mum is more than 99% identical to Chromie 1 forom dad
  - But still just remember the sequences aren't identical and slight differences are important (cancer lol)
- Striking similarity between the two do not apply to the sex chromosomes (X and Y) as they differ in size and genetic composition
  - Certain genes in X is not found in Y chromosome and vice versa
  - They are not homologous chromosomes, but have short regions of homology

# The Cell Cycle Is a Series of Phases That Lead to Cell Division
- Eukaryotic cells are detined to divide through the cell cycle
- Below shows the cell cycle with an n=3 diploid organism, paternal being blue and homoologus maternal being red

Figure 16.2 The eukaryotic cell cycle. Dividing cells advance through a series of phases denoted G₁, S, G₂, and M. This diagram shows the advancement of a cell through the cell cycle to produce two daughter cells. The original diploid cell had three pairs of chromosomes, for a total of six individual chromosomes. During S phase, these replicate to yield 12 chromatids. After mitosis is complete, the two daughter cells each contain six individual chromosomes. The width of the phases shown in this figure is not meant to reflect their actual length. G₁ is typically the longest phase of the cell cycle, whereas M phase is relatively short
