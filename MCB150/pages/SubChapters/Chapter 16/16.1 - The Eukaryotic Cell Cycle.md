> # Learning Goals
> 1. Describe the Features of chromosomes, and explain how sets of chromosomes are examined microscopically
> 2. Outline the phases of Eukaryotic cell cycle
> 3. Explain how cyclins and cdks work together to advance a cell through the eukaryotic cell cycle
>
> - New cells come from division of pre-existing cells
> - *Omnis cellula e cellula*, or if you speak english, Every cell originates from another cell, was proposd by Rudolf Virchow a German biologist
> - This crap is old, and the first living organism just came about from this
> - Anyways, a **Cell Cycle** comes from a series of events leading to cell divsion
>   - Highly regulated so it happens at the right time
>   - Bacterial cells do BINARY FISSION NOT MITOSIS
>   - Eukaryotics have a complex cell cycle as we have more chromosomes to be sorted
> - This section examines phases of the eukaryotic cell cyle and see how it is controlled by proteins carefully monitoring the division to ensure accuracy
> - First, we need to see some general features of chromosomes in eukaryotic species

# Chromosomes Are Inherited in Sets and Occur in Homologous Pairs
