# Chromosomes Are Inherited in Sets and Occur in Homologous Pairs
- In the textbook, we see how cells are obtained from a sample of human blood, specifically chromosomes in the leukocytes (white blood cells) were examined
- They were treated with drugs to stimulate division then centrifuged to concentrate them into a pellet, mixed with a hypotonic solution to make the cells swell
- The expansion of the cells caused the chromosomes to spread out from each other, making it easiser to see individiual chromosome
- Then another centriguation happened and they were treated with a ixative which chemically fixed them in plac eso the chromosomes could no longer move around
- Dying happen, like a Giemsa strain that binds to chromosomes and stains them, giving them a banding pattern, enhancing contrast, and their ability to be uniquely identified

- The cells were placed on a slide and viewed with a light microscope in this example, but in a cytogenetics laboratory, microscopes are equipped with an electronic camera to photograph the chromosomes so they can organize the chromosomes from lartgest to smallest
- A photographic representation of a chromosome is called a **karyotype**, which shows the number, size, and form of chromosomes within an actively dividing cell
  - These chromosomes in actively dividing cells have also already replicated, so the two copies joined together are **sister chromatids**

## *Sets of Chromosomes*
- Studying the karyotypes of species let scientists known that eukaryotic chromosomes occur in sets with different types of chromosomes
  - E.g. 1 set of human chromosomes is 23
- The chromosomes are numbered according to size, largest chromosomes with smaller numbers (1,2 large but 21, 22 small)
- This numbering does not occur for **sex chromosomes** which determine the sex of an individual
  - Designated with the letters X and Y, and males being XY and females being XX
- Chromosomes not being sex chromosomes are called **autosomes**, with us having 22 different types of them
- Another feature of chromosomes found is that that many eukaryotic species carry two sets of chromosomes
  - Humans have 46 total chromosomes due to this trait, each cell having something from the mother and the father
  - When the cells of an organism carries two sets, they are a **diploid**
  - The letter n is used to represent a set of chromosomes, so dipoid are 2n as they have two sets
  - Humans are 2n and n=2
  - Most human cells are diploid with the exeption being gametes in sperm and egg cells
  - Gametes are **haploid**, or 1n, meaning they contain one set of chromosomes
## *Homologous Pairs of Chromosomes*
- If an organism is diploid, the members of a pair of chromosomes are called **homologs**
- **homology** refers to any similarity due to a common ancestry
- Pairs of homologous chromosomes are not usaully identical because over many generations, they have accumulated a lot of genetic changes to make them distinct
- However, they are stupid similar, each being nearly identical in size and super similar composition of genetic material
- A gene found on one copy is usually found on the homolog, but because one homolog is reeived from each parent, the two homologs may vary in the way that a gene affects an organism's traits
- lets see *Herc2*
  - Determining eye color, it is found on chromosome 15
  - One copy may carry eye color genes for brown eyes, whilst the homolog carries for blue eyes
- The DNA sequences on homolog chromosomes are very similar, most cases having the bases on one homolog differing by less than 1% from the sequence on the other homolog
  - E.g. Chromie 1 from mum is more than 99% identical to Chromie 1 forom dad
  - But still just remember the sequences aren't identical and slight differences are important (cancer lol)
- Striking similarity between the two do not apply to the sex chromosomes (X and Y) as they differ in size and genetic composition
  - Certain genes in X is not found in Y chromosome and vice versa
  - They are not homologous chromosomes, but have short regions of homology

# The Cell Cycle Is a Series of Phases That Lead to Cell Division
- Eukaryotic cells are detined to divide through the cell cycle
- Below shows the cell cycle with an n=3 diploid organism, paternal being blue and homoologus maternal being red

Dividing cells advance through a series of phases denoted G₁, S, G₂, and M. This diagram shows the advancement of a cell through the cell cycle to produce two daughter cells. The original diploid cell had three pairs of chromosomes, for a total of six individual chromosomes. During S phase, these replicate to yield 12 chromatids. After mitosis is complete, the two daughter cells each contain six individual chromosomes. The width of the phases shown in this figure is not meant to reflect their actual length. G₁ is typically the longest phase of the cell cycle, whereas M phase is relatively short
</details>

- The phases of the cell cycle are G<sub/>1</sub> (first gap), S (synthesis of DNA, genetic material), G<sub/>2</sub> (Second gap), and M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis).
- G1 and G2 were originally described as gap phases between synthesis and mitosis
- G1, S, and G2 are collectively known as interphase, where the cell grows, copies it chromosomes to cell divide
- Or the cell exits the cell cycle and enters G<sub/>0</sub> (G zero)
  - It is an alternative proceeding through G1, and a G0 cell postponed division, or in the case of terminally differentiated cells (muscles celles in adult) never divide again
  - If it wasn't clear, G0 is the nondividing phase

## *G<sub/>1</sub> Phase*
- Period in life where the cell may be committed to divide, and depending on environment and presence of signaling molecules, a cell in G1 could accumulate molecular changes causing it to progress
- Cell growth usually happens here

## *S Phase*
- Each chromosome is replicated to form a pair of sister chromatids
- Upon completion, a cell has twice as many chromatids as the number of chromosomes in the G<sub/>1</sub> phase
- E.g. we will have 23 at G1 whilst in G2 we would have 46 chromosomes. Except they are pairs so really 46 chromatids and 92 chromatids in respective order

## *G<sub/>2</sub> Phase
- During G<sub/>2</sub> phase, a cell synthesizes the proteins needed for chromosome sorting and cell division.
- Some cell growth may occur

## *M Phase*
- The first part of M phase is mitosis, dividing one cell nucleus into two nuclei, distributing the duplicated chromosomes so each daughter cell receives the same complement of chromosomes
- A human cell in G2 has 92 chromatids, 46 pairs
- During mitosis, they are separated and sorted so each daughter cell gets 46 chromosomes'
- Most cases result in **cytokinesis**, division of the cytoplasm to make 2 distinct daughter cells

## *Cell Cycle Length*
- The length of the cell cycles varies among cell types, several minutes in embryos to several months in slow growing adult cells
- Skin cells are fast dividing, and etake only 10-24 hours
- Phases also vary in length, G1 is longest, M is shortest
- If a cell divides in 24 hours, here are the typical lengths in time

G1: 11 Hours
S Phase: 8 hours
G2 phase: 4 hours
M Phase: 1 hour

- What controls whether a cell divides?
- It is controlled by external factors, like environmental conditions and signaling molecules
- Effects of growth factors are in **Chapter 9** and dear God unironically I hope we do not have to cover anything related to this
- Internal factors also affect cell division, controlling molecules and checkpoints, we will discuss next


# Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependend Kinases Advance a Cell Through the Cell Cycle
- Eukaryotes have the cell cycle highly regulated to ensure cells divide at appropriate times
- This regulation is needed to minimize mutation occurence
- Different categories of proteins are needed so cell division occurs properly

## *Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases*
- Proteins called **cyclins** and **cyclin-dependent kinases** (cdks) are responsible for advancing a cell through the phases of the cell cycle.
- Cyclins are named because their amounts are cyclic (rising and falling levels)
- To be active, cyclin-dependent kinases controlling cell cycle must bind to or be dependent on cyclins
- Numbers of different cyclins and cdks vary from species to species
- The image below shows a good way of how cyclins and cdks work together to advance a cell through the cell cycle

First, lets go over how it works in text:

1. During G<sub/>1</sub> the amount of a particular cyclin termed G<sub/>1</sub> cyclin increases in response to sufficient nutrients and growth factors
2. G<sub/>1</sub> cyclins binds to cdk to form an activated G<sub/>1</sub> cyclin/cdk complex. Activation has cdk function as a protein kinase phosphoryllating other protein needed to advance the cell to the next phase of the cycle. For example, certain proteins in DNA synthesis are phosphorylated and activated, allowing the cell to replicate its DNA in S Phas
3. After the cell passes into the S Phase, G<sub/>1</sub> cyclin is degraded, similar events advance the cell through other phases of the cell cycle
4. A different cyclin, called mitotic cyclin accumulates in late G<sub/>2</sub> binding to a cdk to form an activated mitotic cyclin/cdk complex. This complex phosphorylates proteins needed to advance the cell into M phase. After M phase is done, mitotic cylin is degraded

  <summary>Flavor Text</summary>
This is a general diagram of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Advancement through the cell cycle requires the formation of activated cyclin/cdk complexes. Cells make different types of cyclin proteins, which are typically degraded after the cell has advanced to the next phase. Also, a few different types of cdks are made, depending on the species and cell type. The formation of activated cyclin/cdk complexes is regulated by checkpoint proteins.
</details>

## *Checkpoints*
- We need the chromosomes to be intact when a cell divides
- Three ciritical regulatory points are called checkpoints in the cell cycle of eukaryotic cells
- These checkpoints a variety of proteins, checkpoint proteins, control if a cell can advance past a given checkpoint
- Some function as sensors to check for proper conditions to divide and if these proteins sense something unfavorable, other checkpoint protines will be activated to prevent the cell from advancing
  - These other check point proteins often exert their effects by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases
- At the G<sub/>1</sub> checkpoint, aka the **restriction point**, the checkpoint proteins determine if the conditions are favorable
  - They can also sense if DNA has incurred damage
  - If it is detected, checkpoint proteins prevent formation of active cyclin/cdk complexes stopping advancement of cell cycle
- Another one exists in G<sub/>2</sub>
  - Proteins check DNA for damage ensuring all DNA has been replicated
  - G<sub/>2</sub> checkpoint proteins monitor the levels of the proteins needed to advance through M phase
- Another one is the metaphase checkpoint, monitoring the integrity of the spindle apparatus
  - The spindle apparatus is involved in chromosome sorting
  - Metaphase is a step in mitosis during which all chromosomes are attached to the spindle apparatus
  - If a Chromosome isn't properly attached, the checkpoint protein stops the cell cycle and prevents cells from incorrectly sorting chromosome during division
- Overall, chekcpoint proteins delay the cell cycle until problems are fixed or prevent cell division when problems cannot be fixed
  - Stop division of cells with DNA damage or abnormalities in chromosome number
  - When the functions of checkpoint genes are lost due to mutations, the likelihood of mutations increase
 
# Feature Investigation: Masui and market's Study of Oocyte Maturation Led to the Identification of Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases
- 60s and 70s, they were trying to find the factors promoting cell division
- Yoshio Masui and Clement Markert developed ways to test whether a substance causes a cell to advance from one phase to the next
- They chose frog oocytes, cells maturing into egg cells (already found to be dormant in G<sub/>2</sub> phase of cell cycle for 8 months)
  - During mating season, female frogs make progesterone and it enters oocytes to bind to intracellular receptors advancing it from G<sub/>2</sub> to the M phase where the chromosomes condense and become visible under the microscope
  - This is called maturation, so when the sperm enters, M phase is completed and the zygote continues to undergo cellular division
- Progesterone is a signaling molecule, so Masui and Markert speculated that this hormone affects the functions and/or amounts of proteins triggering the oocyte to advance
- To test this, they did the procedure below on leopard frogs and exposed oocytes to progesterone in vitro, incubating them for 2 hours or 12 hours and used non-progesterone oocytes as the control. These 3 cells are called donor oocytes

- Next they used micropipettes to transfer small amounts of cytosol from 3 types of donor oocytes to recipient oocytes not exposed to progesterone
- The recipients injected were incubated with progesterone for only 2 did not advance to M phase, but if they were incubated for 12 hours they advanced to M phase
- They conclude that cytosolic factor needs 2+ hours to be syntheiszed after progesterone treatment but was transferred to recipient oocytes and induced maturation
- The factor causing oocytes to advance from G<sub/>2</sub> to M phase were originally called maturation-promoting factor (MPF)
- After the discovery of MPF in frogs, it was found in all eukaryotic species studied, being important in division of all cells, not just oocytes
- It took 17 more years before Manfred Lohka, marianne Hayes, and James Maller purified components making up MPF, a difficult undertaking as these components needed small amounts in the cytosol and are easily degraded during purification
- We now know MPF is a complex of mitotic cyclin and a cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) as show 2 images above.
