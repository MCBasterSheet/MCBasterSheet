# Studying the Genomes of Bacteria and Archaea Has Important Applications
- Wait, but why genomes of bacteria and archaea?
  1. Bacteria cause many diseases affecting humans and other animals and plants. Studying the genomes of bacteria reveals important clues about process of infection, letting us combat it better
  2. Some bacteria exhibit mutualistic relationships relying on other bacterial species for growth. Sequencing could help uncover why they are interdependent
  3. The knowledge obtained by studying these two kingdoms applies to more complex organisms
  4. Evolution! The first eukaryotic cell is likely the marriage, sorry, union of an archaeal cell and a bacterial cell.
  5. Bacteria are often used as tools in research. Better know them well :)

# The Genomes of Bacteria and Archaea Typically Consists of a Circular Chromosome with a Few Thousand Genes
- Geneticists made much progress with studying bacterial and archaeal genomes
  - Genomes of thousands of these species have been analyzed
  - The chromosome of bacteria and archaea being only a few million pairs in length (or a megabase pair Mb)
  - Most contain a single type of chromosome with multiple copies of genes in a single cell (some have more than one and isn't the same, like Cholera, yeah the shitty one)
- Bacteria and Archaeal Chromosomes are usualyl circular
  - Linear chromosomes were found though, like Lyme disease
  - I mean some even have both like Cholera but mixed and matched but at least this one only gives crown gall tumors to plants
- Below is a table of sequenced genomes of many bacterial and archaeal species, with genomes ranging from 1.7-5.2 Mb
  - Number of genes is correlated with total genome size, and roughly 1000 genes are found with every megabase pair of DNA
  - You can also laugh at how less complex they are compared to us, HAHAHA

- Anyways, bacteria also have plasmid, and they are small or large. Not really covered here, just go to like 19.4 or 19.5 or just 21.1 to see what is up with them
