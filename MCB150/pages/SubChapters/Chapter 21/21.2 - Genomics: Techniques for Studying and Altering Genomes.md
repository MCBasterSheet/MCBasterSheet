> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Distinguish between genomics and functional genomics
> 2. Outline the steps of DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain-termination method
> 3. Explain how a DNA microarray and RNA-Seq are used to identify the genes that are transcribed by a sample of cells
> 4. Describe how CRIPR-Cas technology can be used to edit genes.
> 5. Explain how gene therapy works
>
> As said throughout Unit 3, the genome is the complete genetic composition of a species. Genomics is the molecular analysis of the entire genome of a species. Segments of chromosomes are cloned and analyzed in progressively smaller pieces, locations of which are known on the intact chromosomes (this is the mapping phase of genomics). Mapping is proceeded with complete DNA sequence determination, the most detailed description of the organism's genome. **Functional genomics** just studies experssion of a genome, checking which genes are on or off in cancer cells. This section considers a few methods used in genomics and functional genomics

# The Dideoxy Chain-Termination Method Is Used to Determine the Base Sequence of DNA
