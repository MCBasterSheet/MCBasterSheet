> As said throughout Unit 3, the genome is the complete genetic composition of a species. Genomics is the molecular analysis of the entire genome of a species. Segments of chromosomes are cloned and analyzed in progressively smaller pieces, locations of which are known on the intact chromosomes (this is the mapping phase of genomics). Mapping is proceeded with complete DNA sequence determination, the most detailed description of the organism's genome. **Functional genomics** just studies experssion of a genome, checking which genes are on or off in cancer cells. This section considers a few methods used in genomics and functional genomics

# The Dideoxy Chain-Termination Method Is Used to Determine the Base Sequence of DNA
- **DNA Sequencing** refers to the procedure aimed at determining the base sequence of DNA
- One types by Sanger and co is **dideoxy chain-termination method**, or dideoxy dsequencing
  - DNA polymerase connects adjacent deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) by catalyzing covalent linkage between phospahte groups at the 5` position on the incoming nucleotide and the -OH group at the 3 prime position on the growing strand
  - Or a chemist can just synthesize a nucleotide called dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) missing the -OH group at the 3` position
  - The ddNTP being added a growing DNA strand causes the strand to no longer grow due to the lack of the 3` -OH Group. This is **chain termination**

- What DNA segment even is analyzed here though?
  - This is the target DNA, obtained in large amounts via gene cloning LAST chapter (not linking it fuck you)
  - Below, the target DNA is inserted next to a primer-annealing site, the place where a primer will bind
  - Initially double-stranded DNA, the DNA is soon denatured into a single strand

- Steps of DNA sequencing (REFER TO IMAGE ABOVE)
  - Many copies of single-stranded template DNA are placed into a tube, mixed with primers binding to the primer-annealing site. DNA polymerase and all four types of dNTPs are also added with LOW AMOUNTS of ddNTPs of all types (ddGTP, ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP) each being tagged with a different colored fluorescent molecules (A green, T red, G yellow, C blue)
  - The tube is incubated, the DNA polymerase synthesizing strands complementary to the target DNA sequence. But ddNTP terminates it early, preventing further elongation of the strand. We then can see its fluorescently glowing green, red, yellow, etc for A,T,G, etc.
  - After the samples have been incubating, newly made DNA strands are separated according to length, either using slab gel, or a gel-filled capillary tube. Shorter strands move to the bottom more quickly than longer ones, and electrophoresis is continued until each band emerges from the bottom of the gel, where a laser excites the fluorescent dye letting a fluorescence detector record number of fluorescence emissions at four wavelengths, corresponding to the four dyes

- Above, looking at the (b) section, one sees the fluorescence detector
  - Peaks show DNA sequence complementary to the target DNA
  - Heights aren't the same, as ddNTPs get incorporated more easily at some sites than others
  - This usually makes a sequence of 700-900 bases long, or even longer
- Researchers are also developing alternative methods to the dideoxy sequencing method in order to sequence DNA
  - These things now superseed this sequencing method, and now considered the next-generation sequencing method
  - We got optical detection now, sequence single DNA molecules, makes it unnecessary to make many copies of template DNA, nanopore sequencing to just read it directly
