> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Describe the key feature of eukaryotic genomes
> 2. Explain how gene duplications occur and lead to the formation of gene families
> 3. List the goals and results of the human genome project

> We now look into eukaryotes, with bigger genomes that are also more ocmplicated. We see how duplication of genes leads to families of realted genes and survey why we have an entire Human Genome project

# Studying the Genomes of Eukaryotes Has Important Applications
- Why eukaryote gnomes?
  - Lets researchers identify and characterize the genes of model oragnisms (yeasts, fruit flies, nematoad worm, thale cress flower, mouse)
  - Lets researchers gather more information for identifying and treating human diseases. The DNA sequence helps them identify genes where the mutation takes place
  - Sequencing the genomes of agriculturally important species can lead to the developmetn of new strains of livestock and crop species with new traits
  - Gnome sequences establish evolutionary relationships

# The Nuclear Genomes of Eukaryotes Are Sets of Linear Chromosomes That Vary Greatly in Size and Composition Among Different Species
- The genome in the nucleus is usually sets of linear chromosomes
  - Humans have 22 autosomes, 1 sex chromosome
- Certain organelles have a small amount of DNA, like the mitochondrion and chloroplast
  - Named mitochondrial or chloroplast genome to distinguish from the nuclear genome, located in the cell nucleus

## *Sizes of Nuclear Genomes*
 - We have found the size of hundred of eukaryotic species. Take a look at the table below

## *Relationship Between Genome Sizes and Repetitive Sequences*
- Eukaryotic genomes are larger than bacterial and archaeal genomes, in number of genes and genome size
- Yeast, a simple eukaryote, carries several thousand protein-coding genes, whilst more complex genomes carry tens of thousands (David and Saul type relationship fr)
- NUMBER OF GENES != GENOME SIZE
  - Genome size is total amount of DNA in megabase pairs
  - Usually increasing genome size means more complexity
  - But many variations in genome size are still observed among species similar in form and function
  - E.g. Total amount of DNA in amphibians vary by 100-fold or just plants globe thisle with related species having similar numbers of chromosomes but one having double the amount of DNA the other has
  - Shit, all of this extra size is also likely just repetitive sequences, short DNA sequences with many copies in the genome (Check them out in [21.5](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/pages/SubChapters/Chapter%2021/21.5%20-%20Repetitive%20Sequences%20and%20Transposable%20Elements.md))

# Core Concept: Evolution
- **Gene Duplications Provide Additional Material for Genome Evolution, Sometimes Leading to the FOrmation of Gene Families**
  - Gene duplications provide more raw material for more genes
  - Duplications make homologous genes, and each version of the gene just acquire different mutations
  - It can happen a lot in evoltuion, and 2+ homologous genes in a single species are called paralogous genes, or **paralogs**
  - Multiple gene duplications followed by mutation accumulation in each paralog results in a **gene family**, group of paralogs carrying out related functions
    - A well studied one is the globin gene in animals
    - They encode the globin (oxygen related) stuff, and 14 paralogs of it exist from one ancestor
    - Came from 500-600mya, and so many duplication events happened that we just have 14 genes on 3 different chromosomes for this, 4 being pseudogenes that have nonfunctional aspects of themselves (not transcribed)
    - This accumulation lets specialization occur, muscle cells and red bloodcells having their own globins
    - Different globins making the 4 can be expressed, and this changing of turning on and off reflects an organisms response to the environment (FUCK CHAPTER 14)

- Duplication, but how?
  - Misaligned crossover due to two homologous chromosomes pairing in meiosis but having homologs misaligned
  - one chromosome having a gene duplication and another a gene deletion and two normal chromosome
  - Each chromosome is put into different haploid cells
  - If a haploid cell carrying the chromosomes with the gene duplication participates in fertilization with another gamete, an offspring with a gene duplication is produced, letting it be transmitted to future generations

# The Human Genome Project Has Stimulated Genomic Research
- Since the mid 1980s, the NIH made the office of Human Genome Research, with James Watson as the first director, beginning October 1, 1990 then finished by the end of 2003, an international collaboration
- Goals?
  - To obtain the DNA sequence of the entire human genome, 3.2 billion basae pairs
  - Identify all human genes
  - Develop technology for generation and management of human genome information (gene cloning, DNA sequencing, computer tools)
  - Analyze genomes of model organisms (E. Coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, A. thaliana, M. musculus)
  - Develop programs focused on understanding and addressing the ethnical, legal, and social implications of the results obtained from the Human Genome Project (who should have access? Schools, law enforcement, insurance companies?)
- Some improvements from the HGP include:
  - Improved diagnosis of genetic disease
  - Identify genetic bases of common disorders, cancer, diabetes, heart disease
  - Many technological advances in DNA sequencing, faster and less expesnive sequencing methods made. Down from 500-1000million to just 1000 or less for a whole person's genome
