> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Describe the key feature of eukaryotic genomes
> 2. Explain how gene duplications occur and lead to the formation of gene families
> 3. List the goals and results of the human genome project
>
> We now look into eukaryotes, with bigger genomes that are also more ocmplicated. We see how duplication of genes leads to families of realted genes and survey why we have an entire Human Genome project

# Studying the Genomes of Eukaryotes Has Important Applications
- Why eukaryote gnomes?
  - Lets researchers identify and characterize the genes of model oragnisms (yeasts, fruit flies, nematoad worm, thale cress flower, mouse)
  - Lets researchers gather more information for identifying and treating human diseases. The DNA sequence helps them identify genes where the mutation takes place
  - Sequencing the genomes of agriculturally important species can lead to the developmetn of new strains of livestock and crop species with new traits
  - Gnome sequences establish evolutionary relationships

# The Nuclear Genomes of Eukaryotes Are Sets of Linear Chromosomes That Vary Greatly in Size and Composition Among Different Species
- The genome in the nucleus is usually sets of linear chromosomes
  - Humans have 22 autosomes, 1 sex chromosome
- Certain organelles have a small amount of DNA, like the mitochondrion and chloroplast
  - Named mitochondrial or chloroplast genome to distinguish from the nuclear genome, located in the cell nucleus

## *Sizes of Nuclear Genomes*
 - We have found the size of hundred of eukaryotic species. Take a look at the table below

## *Relationship Between Genome Sizes and Repetitive Sequences*
- Eukaryotic genomes are larger than bacterial and archaeal genomes, in number of genes and genome size
- Yeast, a simple eukaryote, carries several thousand protein-coding genes, whilst more complex genomes carry tens of thousands (David and Saul type relationship fr)
- NUMBER OF GENES != GENOME SIZE
  - Genome size is total amount of DNA in megabase pairs
  - Usually increasing genome size means more complexity
  - But many variations in genome size are still observed among species similar in form and function
  - E.g. Total amount of DNA in amphibians vary by 100-fold or just plants globe thisle with related species having similar numbers of chromosomes but one having double the amount of DNA the other has
  - Shit, all of this extra size is also likely just repetitive sequences, short DNA sequences with many copies in the genome (Check them out in [21.5](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/pages/SubChapters/Chapter%2021/21.5%20-%20Repetitive%20Sequences%20and%20Transposable%20Elements.md))
