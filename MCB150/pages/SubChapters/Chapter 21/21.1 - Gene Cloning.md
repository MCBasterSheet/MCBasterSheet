> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Outline the steps of gene cloning using vectors
> 2. Distinguish between a genomic library and a cDNA library
> 3. Explain how gel electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments
> 4. Describe the steps of gene cloning using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
>
> Gene cloning lets one make many copies of a particular gene, below showing the steps and goals of gene cloning. Gene cloning is used to either study DNA directly or use the DNA as a tool. It can also be used to obtain a large amount of gene product, like a specific protein.
