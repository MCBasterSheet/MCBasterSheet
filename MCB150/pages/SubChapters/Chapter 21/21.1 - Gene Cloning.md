# Step 1: Vector DNA and Chromosomal DNA Are the Starting Materials for Gene Cloning
- Using **vectors** (latin for who carries) that act as a carrier of the DNA segment to be cloned
  - Vectors can carry a small segment of chromosomal DNA, like a single gene
  - A chromosome could carry up to a few thousand genes, so less efficient
  - When a vector is introduced to a living cell, it replicates, and so the DNA it carries also is
  - This produces many copies of the inserted gene
- Vectors commonly used in gene cloning comes from 2 natural sources:
  - **Plasmids** are small circular pieces of DNA found in strains of bacteria and exist independently of bacterial chromosome
    - Commercially available plasmids have been genetically engineered for effective use in cloning experiments
    - They contain unique sites where geneticists easily insert pieces of chormosomal DNA
  - **Viral Vectors** come from viruses, infecting living cells and propagating themselves by taking control of the host cell's metabolic machinery
    - When a chromosomal gene is inserted into a viral vector, the gene is replicated whenever the viral DNA is replicated
    - Viruses can be used as vectors to carry other pieces of DNA
- The second material needed for cloning a gene is the gene itself, or **The Gene of Interest**
  - The source of the gene is the chromosomal DNA carrying the gene
  - Preparation of chromosomal DNA involves breaking open cells to extract and purify the DNA
  - Purification usually uses chromatograph and centrifugation

# Step 2: Cutting Chromosomal and Vector DNA into Pieces and Linking Them Together Produces Recombinant Vectors
- The second step is insertion
  - DNA moelcules are cut and pasted into vectors to make recombinant vectors
  - Cutting DNA requires **restriction enzymes** (HELLO MY IB151 FRIENDS, YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH SO MUCH OF THIS SHIT!!!!!)
  - These enzymes, found by Arber, Smith, and Nathans are natually made by many different species of bacteria
  - Basically CRISPR cutting things ya know that protect the cell
  - These are commercially available
- Restriction enzymes work by binding to specific base sequences then cleaving the DNA backbone at 2 defined location, one in each strand
  - Most are palindromic (racecar)
  - *Eco*RI has 5`-GAATTC-3 on the top, and the bottom is also 5-GAATTC-3 (SEE TABLE BELOW)
  - Certain restriction enzymes are useful in cloning as they digest DNA into fragments with single-stranded ends (sticky ends) that hydrogen-bond to other DNA fragments cut with the same enzyme and thus have complementary sequences

- Below shows how *Eco*RI does the insertion of a gene into a vector
  - This vector, a plasmid, carries the *amp<sup/>R</sup>* and *lacZ* genes
  - They bind to specific sequences in both vector and chromosomal DNA, cleaving the backbone, making sticky DNA fragment ends
  - The sticky ends of chromosomal DNA and vector DNA can hydrogen-bond with each other, process called annealing

- The interaction between sticky ends is not stable, using only a few hydrogen bonds between complementary bases
  - Permanence requires the sugar-phosphate backbones to be covalently linked, or ligated
  - This is done with DNA ligase, that forms covalent bonds between two adjacent DNA fragments
- Sometimes, the two sticky ends of the vector just ligate back together, restoring it to its original ciruclar structure, forming a recircularized vector
  - Sometimes, a fragment of chromosomal DNA becomes ligated to both sticky ends of the vector
  - This causes a segment of Chromosomal DNA to be inserted into the vector
  - This creates a vector with Chromosomal DNA, a **recombinant vector**, ready to be cloned
  - It can carry the gene of interest, or just a random one... fucking bs

# Step 3: The Uptake of Recombinant Vectors into Host Cells Followed by the Growth of Those Cells Achieves Gene Cloning
- We now clone the gene of interest
- The goal is for the recombinant vector carrying the desired gene to be taken up by bacterial cells treated with agents rendering them permeable to DNA molecules
- Called transformation, described in Chapter 19, bacterial cells able to take DNA from the extracellular environment are called **competent**
  - Bacteria mixed with recircularized vectors and recombinant vectors, some bacterial cells take up a single vector, although many cells fail to take any vector
  - The bacteria are then inoculated onto petri plates containing bacterial growth medium and ampicillin

- Shown above, bacterial cells were originally sensitive to ampicillin, but the vector, a plasmid, carries an antibiotic resistance gene called *amp<sup/>R</sup>* gene
  - But why? The gene is a selectable marker as the presence of the antibiotic selects for the growth of cells expressing the *amp<sup/>R</sup>* gene
- The *amp<sup/>R</sup>* gene encodes an enzyme known as beta-lactamase degrading the antibiotic ampicillin
  - Now it doesn't kill it, so any bacterium taking up plasmids of *amp<sup/>R</sup>* grows and divides into colonies
- The experimenter also needs to find a way to distinguish bacterial colonies with cells of a recombinant vector from those with a recircularized vector
  - Recombinant vectors, a chromosomal DNA has been inserted into a region of the vector containing *lacZ* gene, encoding beta-galactosidase
    - Insertion of chromosomal DNA disrupts *lacZ* gene, preventing synthesis of Beta-galactosidase
  - A recircularized vector has a function *lacZ* gene
  - Now you can find the functionality by putting it in a growth medium of X-Gal, cleaved by Beta-galactosidase, making a blue color
    - Bacteria in X-Gal form blue colonies if *lacZ* functions (recircularized), white colonies do not have a functional *lacZ* (recombinant)
- After a bacterial cell takes up a recombinant vector, 2 events lead to the production of many copies of that vector
  - When the vector has a highly active ori, the bacterial host cell, produces many copies of the recombinant vector per cell
  - The bacterial cells divide every 20 min, so overnight growth creates millions of bacteria obtained from a single cell
    - E.g. a colony has 10 million cells, each having 50 copies, so in total we have 500 million copies of the cloned gene

# A DNA Library Is a Collection of Many Different DNA Fragments Cloned into Vectors
- The two models above shows treament of chromosomal DNA with restriction enzymes, yielding many different DNA fragments
  - After ligation of fragments, a researcher has a collection of many recombinant vectors, each vector containing a particular fragment of chromosomal DNA
  - A collection of recombinant vectors containing DNA fragments of a given organism is known as a DNA library, and DNA libraries let researchers easily clone a gene of interest

- 2 Types of libraries of made
  - If inserts come from chromosomal DNA, one has a **genomic library**
  - If mRNA and reverse transcriptase is used to make DNA molecules using mRNA as a starting materia, then you have **complementary DNA**, or **cDNA** to make a **cDNA Library**, a collection of recombinant vectors having inserts derived from cDNA
- cDNA is important as it lacks introns, sequences not translated into proteins
  - Why? INTRONS ARE FUCKING HUGE
  - Just look at cDNAs into vectors than chromosomal DNA segments,  shorter and more compact
  - Also, bacteria doesn't splice introns, so cDNA lets the researcher more easily express the gene of interest

# Gel Electrophoresis Separates Macromolecules, Such as DNA Fragments
- **Gel Electrophoresis** is a technique for separating macromolecules, like DNA and proteins as they migrate through a gel
  - This evalutates cloning experiments
  - It lets the researcher comapare the different sizes of DNA fragments inserted into recombinant vectors
- Gel Electrophoresis separates molecules based on charge, size/length, and mass
  - Electrophoresis does it dues on a flat slab of semisolid gel with depressions called wells
  - Electrodes are at the end of each gel, and a current runs through the gel, causing proteins or nucleic acids to migrate from the top to the bottom
  - DNA is negatively charged and moves towards the positively charged electrode, at the bottom of the figure

- As gel electrophoresis occurs, the DNA fragments are separated into distinct bands
- Smaller DNA fragments move more quickly through the gel than larger ones in a given amount of time, and move farther
- The fragments are also dyed so you can actually identify, let alone see them
