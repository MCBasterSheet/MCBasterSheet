# Learning Outcome: Describe how Pyruvate is broken down and Acetyl CoA is made
- Eukaryotes have glycolysis produce pyruvate in the cytosol, then the pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria
- In the mitochondrial matrix, pryuvate is broken down by **pyruvate dehydrogenase**
- CO2 is removed from pyruvate, and the remaining acetyl group is attache dto an organic molecule called coenzyme A (**CoA**) to produce acetyl CoA
  - Some ehcemical equations have CoA as CoA-SH to emphasize how the -SH group participates during the chemical reaciton
- This process removes 2 eleectrons from pyruvate and transferred to NAD+ with H+ to make NADH
- The acetyl group is attached to CoA via covalent bond to a sulfer atom
  - Hydrolyzing this bond produces large amounts of free energy so the acetyl group can be transferred to other molecules
  - Then this acetyl group is removed from the CoA and eneters the Citric Acid Cycle
