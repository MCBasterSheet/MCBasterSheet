# The 3rd Stage of Glucose Metabolism: The Metabolic cycle
- During this cycle, particular particles enter, and particular particles leave.
- It is cyclical as the series of organic molecules are regenerated with each turn of the cycle
- This was done by (again) a german guy named Hans Krebs
  - He analyzed pigeon muscles and found citric acid and other organic molecules resulting in the breakdown of carbs to CO2
  - This is the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle

- Steps of the citric acid cycle
  - 1. The acetyl group (2 Carbons) is removed from the acetyl CoA and attached to oxaloacetate (four carbons) forming citrate (six carbons) making citric acid
    2. Then two Co2 molecules are released, where NADH + FADH2 and GTP are made
       - GTP is made via substrate-level phosphorylation to make ATP
    3. This is an eight step process, in which Oxaloacetate is then regenerated and the cycle begins again (provided acetyl CoA is available)  
 
# Regulation of the Citric Acid Cycle
- The rate of the cycle is regulated by the availability of substrates, like acdetyl-CoA and NAD+ and by feedback inhibition
- 3 steps in the cycle are highly exergonic
  - They are catalyzed by citrate synthase, isocitrate, dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
  - Each step is rate-limiting under certain circumstances and the way they are regulated varies among different species
  - In mammals, NADH and ATP are the feedback inhibitors for isocitrate dehydrogenase
    - NAD+ and ADP are activators
  - The citric acid cycle is inhibited when NADH and ATP levels are high, and is stimulated when NAD+ and ADP levels are high

- Thorough steps of the Citric Acid Cycle:
1. Acetyl CoA + H2O -> citrate (C6H5O7) + CoA-SH (via Citrate Synthetase)
  - This is when people think the cycle "Begins," mainly because it starts from the last step
  - It does not actually begin, as there is no beginning of a cycle
  - This is when the **acetyl group** from the **Acetyl CoA** is **attached** to **Oxaloacetate** to form **citrate**

2. Citrate -> Isocitrate (Via Aconitase)
  - A 2 step reaction causes citrate to be rearranged into an isomer as isocitrate

3. Isocitrate -> alpha-ketoglutarate (via Isocitrate dehydrogenase)
   - Isocitrate is oxidized to alpha-ketoglutarate.
   - **CO2 is released**
   - **NADH is formed**

4. alpha-ketoglutarate -> Succinyl CoA (via alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase)
   - Alpha-Ketoglutarate is oxidized as it combines with CoA to form succinyl CoA.
   - **CO2 is released**
   - **NADH is formed**

5. Succinyl CoA -> Succinate + CoA (via Succinyl-CoA Synthetaste)
   - Succinyl CoA is broken down to **CoA and succinate**
   - Exergonic, driving the **synthesis of GTP**
   - Transfers phosphate to ADP **Forming ATP**

6. Succinate -> Fumarate (via Succinate Dehydrogenase)
   - Succinate oxidized to fumarate
   - **FADH2 is made**

7. Fumarate + H2O -> Malate (via Fumarase)
   - Fumarate combines with water to make malate

8. Malate -> Oxaloacetate (via Malate dehydrogenase)
   - Malate is oxidized to make **oxaloacetate**
   - **NADH is made**
