> # Learning Goals:
> Explain how Carbohydrate, protein, and fat, metabolism are interconnected

## The same Enzymes are used for the Breakdown of different starting molecules
- Eating a meal has a lot of macromolecules
- So make all of the macromolecules go down the same path to be more efficient

- ## Proteins and Fats can enter glycolysis or the citric acid cycle at different points
  - Proteins are first acted on by enzymes (digestive juices or within cells)
    - These enzymes cleave bonds connecting individual amino acids
    - Due to the differing side chains, they can enter at different points in the pathway
    - Breakdown products of some amino acids can enter at later steps of glycolysis
      - Acetyl groups in some amino acids can become attached to CoA then enter the citric acid cycle
    - Other amino acids care modified to enter the Citric Acid cycle
      
  - Fats are typically borken down to glycerol and fatty acids
    - Glycerol can be modified to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and enter clycolysis
    - Lipid tails can have two carbon acetyl units removed, binding to CoA to enter the citric acid cycle
