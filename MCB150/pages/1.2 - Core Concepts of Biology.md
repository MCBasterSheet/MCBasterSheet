- We got five things to identify
	- Evolution, the heritable change in a population of organisms from generation to generation.
		- As a result of evolution, populations are better adapted to their environment. This has been proved with fossil records.
	- Structure and function, pertains to verty tiny biological molecules and to very large biological structures.
		- E.g. The feet of different birds shows a good example. Aquatic birds have webbed feet to paddle, and non-aquatic birds have fingers.
	- Information, comes in the form of genetic material in DNA
		- During reproduction, a copy of this blueprint is transmitted from parents to offspring. DNA is heritable. Offspring tend to have their parent's features.
	- Energy and Matter, where due to the fact that all living organisms use energy and matter to live, we need to know this!
		- E.g. Sunflowers take energy from the sun, the matter from water and CO2, and they make ENERGY and flowers.
	- Systems are when parts of an organism interact with each other or with the external environment to create novel structures and functions.
		- E.g. the human eye is composed of many different types of cells that are organized to sense incoming light. Our ability to see is a complex arrangement of different cell types.
