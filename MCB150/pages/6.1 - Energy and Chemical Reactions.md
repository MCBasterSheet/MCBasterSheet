> # Direction and Rate govern the aspects of a chemical reaction in a living cell
>
> `Generalized chemical Reaction: aA + bB â‡Œ cC + dD`
>
> A and B are reactants, C and D are products, and a, b, c, and d are the numbers of moles of reactants and products
> This is a reversible reaction, meaning A and B could be turned to C to D and vice versa.
>
> There are two directions, C+D being made (forward) and A+B being made (reverse direction), both depending on energy and concentrations of all the chemicals.
>
> This section Mainly Covers how the interplay of energy and reactant concentrations govern the direction of a chemical reaction. We will learn that cells use energy for these intermediate molecules, like ATP, to drive chemical reactions in a desired direction

# Energy Exists in Different Forms
  - Energy is the ability to cause change or work
    - Kinetic Energy is the energy associated with movement, like moving a baseball bat from one palce to another
    - Potentional energy is the energy a substanc eorr object possesses due to its structure or locationi
      - Ball held high, or electron in atom due to its position relative to other atoms
      - For electrons, the higher it is, the more potential energy it has
      - The potnetial energy stored in the bonds is **Chemical Potential Energy**
        - Released during chemical reactions
        - Glucose has a lot of potential energy, and it is used to make ATP (energy intermediate)
