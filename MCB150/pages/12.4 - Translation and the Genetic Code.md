> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Explain how the genetic code specifies the relationship between the sequence of codons in mRNA and the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide
> 2. Analyze the experiments of Nirenberg and Leder that leg to the deciphering of the genetic code
>
> - For a while, we've just been talking about the first stages of the central dogma, like how RNA transcript is made from DNA and how eukaryotes process it
> - We are using messenger RNA as it transmits information from DNA to cellular components called ribosomes, which is the synthesis of polypeptides using information from the mRNA
> - To see translation, we examine genetic code, specifying the relationship between the bases in the mRNA and the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide
> - We also see experiment that cracks the code
