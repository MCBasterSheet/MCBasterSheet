> - For a while, we've just been talking about the first stages of the central dogma, like how RNA transcript is made from DNA and how eukaryotes process it
> - We are using messenger RNA as it transmits information from DNA to cellular components called ribosomes, which is the synthesis of polypeptides using information from the mRNA
> - To see translation, we examine genetic code, specifying the relationship between the bases in the mRNA and the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide
> - We also see experiment that cracks the code

# The Genetic Code Specifies the Amino Acids Within a Polypeptide
- Ability of mRNA -> Amino Acid of a polypeptide relies on the genetic code
- The code is based on 3 nucleotide base sequences known as **codons**
- The genetic code has 64 different codons (4 codons ^ 3 base slots)
  - Each sequence of the 3 bases specifies a particular amino acid
  - E.g. the codon CCC specifies Proline, and GGC specifies Glycine.
- From analyzing basically every species you can think of, genetic code is universal. Only a few exceptions have been discovered

- 64 codons combinations, but 20 types of amino acids? This is because genetic code is said to be **degenerate** as more than one codon specifies the same amino acid
  - e.g. the codon GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG all code for glycine. Most of the time, it is the third codon being the degenerate/variable base

# During Translation, mRNA is Used to Make a Polypeptide with a Specific Amino Acid Sequence
- Check the image below for the:
  - Ribosomal-binding site: A site located near the 5` end of the mRNA and provides a location for the ribosome to bind to the mRNA
  - Start Codon: First codon used in translation, determines where translation begins. Start codon is AUG (methionine) and is a few nucleotides from the ribosomal-binding site.
    - Also defines the **reading frame** of an mRNA, the order in which codons are read during translation.
    - At the start codon, each adjacent codon is read as a group of 3 bases, a triplet, in the 5` to 3 prime direction
    - E.g.: The two mRNA sequences are their corresponding amino acid sequences

    - Sequence one is how the mRNA codons would be correctly translated into amino acids
    - The second sequence has an additional U, shifting the reading frame and changing the codons occuring in the 5` to 3 prime direction.
    - Now they all have a very different sequence of amino acids, therefore a small change in DNA and mRNA sequence has a profound change on the amino acid sequence; furthermore, with a reading frame that doesn't overlap, each base is found within a single codon
  - Coding Sequence: The region that begins with the start codon and specifies the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. A typical one being a few hundred Amino Acids in length. The coding sequence is a series of codons
  - Stop Codon: The last codon, signaling the end of translation. These codons are known as **termination codons** being UAA, UAG, and UGA. They **DO NOT** code for an amino acid

# DNA Stores Information, Whereas mRNA and tRNA Access That Information to Make Polypeptides
- The relationship of a DNA gene sequence, the mRNA transcribed from the gene, and the polypeptide sequence can all be found in the image below
- The template strand is used to make mRNA, the resulting mRNA strand also corresponds to the coding strand of DNA, except the U in mRNA instead of T in DNA.
- The 51 end of the mRNA contains an untranslated region (5` UTR) as does the 3 prime end (3 prime UTR)
- The middle portion contains a series of codons that actually specify the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide
