# Reflections on Past Relationships and MCB150 Class

## Introduction
- Reflecting on past relationships, specifically mentioning a college relationship with a girl obsessed with counting.
- Expressing curiosity about her current activities.

## MCB150 Class Announcements
- Greeting and apologies for potential obstructions caused by speakers.
- Mention of Usher's Super Bowl halftime show and its connection to an appearance in Urbana.

## Exam Scores
- Class average: 64.2% with a cutoff of 64 for Cs.
- Distribution compared with historical data over the last 15 years.
- Consistency of scores between exams and quests highlighted.

## Cellular Respiration Discussion
- Focus on the movement of pyruvate into phase two.
- Explanation of mitochondrial structure: outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix.
- Clarification of misconceptions about the matrix being the innermost part.

## Mitochondrial Structure
- Details on mitochondrial structure using a color-coded cartoon representation.
- Introduction of the term "Christie" for inversions of the inner membrane.
- Answer to a student's question about the uniqueness of mitochondria.

## Key Points About Mitochondria
- Mention of the typical composition of the outer membrane.
- Emphasis on the high protein content in the intermembrane space.
- Explanation of the lack of porins preventing free proton movement.
- Description of the matrix as the location for Krebs cycle reactions.

## pH of Intermembrane Space
- Discussion of the pH of the intermembrane space being equivalent to the cytoplasmic pH.
- Emphasis on the interplay between the cytoplasm and intermembrane space pH.

## Phase Two: Pyruvate Oxidation
- Introduction to phase two of cellular respiration, focusing on pyruvate oxidation.
- Explanation of the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).
- Emphasis on the exergonic nature of the process and the addition of a coenzyme A molecule.

## Krebs Cycle
- Introduction of the Krebs cycle as the next step, starting with the formation of citric acid.
- Explanation of the cyclical nature of the Krebs cycle, emphasizing that cycles have no true beginning or ending.
- Highlighting the involvement of acetyl CoA in maintaining the cycle.

## Citric Acid Formation
- Detailed explanation of the steps of citric acid formation, including isocitrate formation and subsequent carbon dioxide releases.
- Emphasis on the exergonic nature of these steps and their connection to NAD+ reduction.
- Overall purpose: to strip carbons and transfer energy to NAD+.

## Substrate-Level Phosphorylation
- Final steps involving substrate-level phosphorylation reactions, with the breakdown of coenzyme A providing the energy.
- Reiteration of the cyclical nature of the Krebs cycle, connecting it to the overall process of cellular respiration.

In summary, the speaker covers personal reflections, class announcements, exam scores, and an in-depth discussion of cellular respiration, focusing on mitochondria structure, pH regulation, and the Krebs cycle. The complex processes are explained with an emphasis on key concepts and connections between different stages of cellular respiration.
