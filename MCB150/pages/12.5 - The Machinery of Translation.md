> # Learning Outcomes:
> 1. Described the Structure and Function of tRNA
> 2. Explain how aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases attached amino acids to tRNAs
> 3. Outline the structural features of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes
> 4. Analyze how ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is used to evaluate evolutionary relationships among different species
> - Translation requires more componenets as the sequence of codons in an mRNA molecule must be translated as a sequence of amino acids according to the genetic code
> - A single protein cannot accomplish such a task, instead, many different proteins and RNA molecules interact in intricate steps to synthesize a polypeptide
> - Using mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, and translation factors, a cell can synthesize polypeptides

> - Cells use an unholy and substantially absurd amount of energy to translate mRNA into polypeptides.
>   - E.g. E Coli uses 90% of their cellular energy for this process
> - Translation is therefore important as hell, so this section sees the components of the translation MACHINERY and then what happens in the stages of translation as they happen in living cells

# Transfer RNAs Share Common Structural Features
- To see how tRNAs function as carriers of the correct amino acids during translation, researchers have examined their structural characteristics.
- The tRNAs of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes share common features
- Proposed in 1965 by Robert Holley, the 2d structure of a tRNA molecule resembles a cloverleaf
  - The structure of a tRNA has 3 stem-loops with a fourth stem with a 3` single-stranded region (shown below)
  - The stem is the region where RNA is double-stranded due to complementary base pairing via hydrogen bonds, and the loops are areas without base pairing (THE PARALLEL AREAS ARE HYDROGEN BONDS WITH COMPLEMENTARY PAIRING AND THE 3 LOOPS HAVE NON!
  - The anticodon is located at the loop of the middle step-loop region (BOTTOM MOST LOOP)
  - The 3` single-stranded region is the amino acid attachment site (EXTRA STICKOUT AREA)
  - The 3 structure of tRNA molecules involve additional folding of the secondary structure

- Cells in every organism can make many different tRNA molecules encoded by different genes
- tRNA is named according to the amino acid is carried, so tRNA<sup>Ser</sup> has serine in it
  - Due to genetic code containing 6 different serine codons, the cell can produce more than one type of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup>
