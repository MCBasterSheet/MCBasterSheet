> 2. Describe the double-stranded structure of DNA, and explain how the AT/GC rule underlies the ability of DNA to be replicated semiconservatively

> # Watson and Crick immediately suggested a DNA Copy mechanisms
>    - They said we used DNA replication
>    - Original DNA strands were used as templates for new DNA strands
>    - This section looks at how early experiments helped determine the mechanism of DNA replication and examining the characteristics enabling the double helix to be faithfully copied

# Meselson and Stahl Investigated Three Proposed Mechanisms of DNA Replication
- In the late 1950s, 3 Models were found for DNA replication
  - All models had 2 daughter strands to be made
  - The Original strands are all parental strands
- First model is semiconservative
  - Double-stranded DNA is half conserved following the replication process
  - New Double-stranded DNA contains one parental strand and a daughter strand
  - It is most consistent with Watson and Crick's Proposal
- Conservative Mechanism
  - Both Parent strands of DNA remain together following DNA replication
  - The Original Arrangement of parental strands is conserved
  - 2 Newly made and helical daughter strands are also made following replication
- Dispersive Mechnisms
  - Segments of parent and daughter DNA are interspersed in both Strands after replication

# Meselson and Stahl Experiment
- 1958, American biologists Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl made experimental approach to find out which one of three are most correct
- They used Nitrogen and its isotopes to figure it in in E. Coli
- Here is the procedure
    1. Grew E. Coli for many generations in a 15N environment creating a population of nearly all 15N Bacteria
    2. Then it switches to a medium of mostly 14N as a nitrogen source. They divided, then samples were collected after one generation. This made all new DNA strands have light nitrogen and original strands having the heavy form
    3. Then CENTRIFUGE! and all the DNA molecules were separated based on density. The solutions sit in a Cesium Chloride salt gradient. All 15N went to the bottom of the gradient, and all with 14N went closer to the top. If a DNA was half-heavy, then they would be in the middle of the gradient
    4. The DNA is highlighted in the gradient with a UV light
    5. One cell doubling later, they found all DNA to be half-heavy. These results shown semiconservative and dispersive properties. Conservative was deemed impossible as it would have made a top and bottom set of DNA
