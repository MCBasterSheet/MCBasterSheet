> 1. Discuss and interpret the experiment of Meselson and Stahl
> 2. Describe the double-stranded structure of DNA, and explain how the AT/GC rule underlies the ability of DNA to be replicated semiconservatively
>
> 3. # Watson and Crick immediately suggested a DNA Copy mechanisms
> 4. - They said we used DNA replication
>    - Original DNA strands were used as templates for new DNA strands
>    - This section looks at how early experiments helped determine the mechanism of DNA replication and examining the characteristics enabling the double helix to be faithfully copied

# Meselson and Stahl Investigated Three Proposed Mechanisms of DNA Replication
- In the late 1950s, 3 Models were found for DNA replication
  - All models had 2 daughter strands to be made
  - The Original strands are all parental strands
- First model is semiconservative
  - Double-stranded DNA is half conserved following the replication process
  - New Double-stranded DNA contains one parental strand and a daughter strand
  - It is most consistent with Watson and Crick's Proposal
- Conservative Mechanism
  - Both Parent strands of DNA remain together following DNA replication
  - The Original Arrangement of parental strands is conserved
  - 2 Newly made and helical daughter strands are also made following replication
- Dispersive Mechnisms
  - Segments of parent and daughter DNA are interspersed in both Strands after replication
