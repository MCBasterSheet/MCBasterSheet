- Let's talk about how things used to be, classification-wise, how they are now. When Carolus Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, started classifying organisms, all organisms were given, they were grouped based on their characteristics. Basically, if you made your own food, you were called a plant. If you could move, you were called an animal. Okay, well, that only works for the plants and the animals. There's an awful lot more life on this planet that isn't a plant or an animal. We do still give brand new species a genus and species name. We do still use the Linnaean taxonomy scheme, but we have to acknowledge that it's not just plants and animals, right? There's a lot more. The microbial world was unknown to Swedish botanists back in the 1800s. Eventually, we got the technology where we could start looking inside individual cells. And a big primary observation was made. There were two different kinds of cells. Those that if you looked in them using microscopes, you could see a nugget, a kernel. The Greek word for kernel is karyon. So organisms that have this kernel in their cells, that have this kernel in them, are called eukaryotes. E-U is a prefix that in science, well, probably other places too, but in science itaryon. So organisms that have this kernel in their cells, that have this kernel in them, are called eukaryotes. E-U is a prefix that in science, well probably other places too, but in science it means true. So a true nucleus. We don't call it a kernel, we actually more scientifically call it a nucleus, but that's the nugget, that's the kernel that you could see. That level of resolution in microscopy couldn't allow them to see anything else, but it did help them differentiate those cells from the ones that don't have any kernels inside them. And the prefix pro- means several things, depends on context. In this context, pro- means before or without. So without the kernel, without the nugget in them, they were called prokaryotes. So organisms, either the cells in an organism either have a nucleus or they don't. You're either a eukaryote or you're a prokaryote. And a typical prokaryotic cell isn't very exciting to look at at first glance. You can see where its genome is. That's a word that we haven't defined yet. It's going to mean the collected resources you have in terms of genetic capabilities, right? Your genome is your DNA. It's your blueprints. Let's just call them blueprints for now. For those of you who are kind of new to biology, I don't expect you to know anything about DNA yet. We'll get there. We'll get there. But you can kind of see that in a prokaryotic cell, that DNA, that genome is pushed over. It's your blueprints. Let's just call them blueprints for now. For those of you who are kind of new to biology, I don't expect you to know anything about DNA yet. We'll get there. We'll get there. But you can kind of see that in a prokaryotic cell, that DNA, that genome is pushed over to a side of the cell, but it's not separated from the rest of the cell by any physical barrier. So we don't call it a nucleus. The nucleus is a physically separated compartment away from everything else in the cell. We don't call it a nucleus. We call it a nucleoid. And there's usually just one copy of a great big mass of DNA in these cells. The prokaryotic cells, always, as every cell does, has a membrane that separates it from the extracellular world, everything around it. And then most prokaryotes, this is not universal, but it's certainly common, most prokaryotes have a cell wall around that. You're probably familiar with plant cell walls, at least the existence of a plant cell wall, made of completely different stuff. Don't think that prokaryotes are just plants that have these weird tails on them and stuff. They're not. The walls are made of different things. And at some level, especially when that's all you can see, there's nothing more interesting about a prokaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells tend to look a little more interesting because you see different regions that don't all look the same. This is a representation, a gross oversimplification I might add, a representation of an animal cell. How do we know it's not a plant? Well, talk about cell walls just a second ago. There's no cell wall around the plasma or cell membrane of the cell, so it's not a plant. And it also doesn't have any chloroplasts in it. You can see some of these compartments have been identified and the ones that have been drawn have been labeled. There's no chloroplasts in there. That's how we would know that this isn't a plant cell. But really, the take-home point of this slide is that eukaryotes have compartmentalization. They are typically larger. That increased volume gives them the ability to say, hey, what if I did this job over here and this job over here? And since those jobs might need to happen in different chemical environments, I can separate them and have a different chemical environment here than I do over here. But if the chemistry is going to be different, there has to be something physically separating them. Those are called membrane-bound organelles. So there are membranes similar to the one that separates the cell from the rest of the world that are the boundaries of those organelles. We will talk about these organelles starting Monday, and then we'll keep referring back to them and a few more throughout the rest of the semester. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that I have a love-hate relationship with a lot of textbook kind of figures like this one and I drew this and I still hate certain things about it. I hate the fact that when we draw these oversimplified representations of eukaryotic cells, it looks like there's all this free space you can just go run around, right? And oh, there's one mitochondria and there's oh, a little Golgi apparatus over here. But the reality is this cell may have a hundred to a thousand different mitochondria in it and its Golgi apparatus may even have two Golgi bodies and its system of endoplasmic reticulum probably extends almost all the way out to the boundary of the cell. It is so unbelievably crowded inside a eukaryotic cell that it's almost impossible for us as new students to molecular biology to even fathom. And yet, things are still getting done. Work is still getting done. This is why life, this is why cellular biology is so amazing. Molecules are moving faster than you can imagine, and they're bumping into everything else all the time. It is so super crowded in there. That's why this is terribly unrealistic, but it's what we work with. So until 1977, until about 1977, organisms were classified into super kingdoms. There were prokaryotes. Those are these simple cells that don't have their genetic material separated by a membrane, and there are also no other, for purposes of MCB 150, no other membrane-bound organelles as well. Every time I say, for purposes of MCB 150, what I'm doing is acknowledging, oh, there's more to the story. Trust me, you're not responsible for the rest of the story. You're only responsible for the level of detail that we cover in this class. So when I say prokaryotes don't have organelles, and you find some obscure species of bacteria that has these little organelles in them, and some of them do, that's not the way you answer your exam question. We're going by, unless I specifically say, hey, the exception is just as important as the rule, we're just going to go with what follows for purposes of MCB 150. So for purposes of MCB 150, prokaryotes lack organelles. Eukaryotes have organelles, and their genetic material is inside this big master control center called the nucleus. And that's fine. We can categorize relationships between organisms by what they look like, but it's not good enough. Just because this cell looks like that cell doesn't mean they have any relationship, really. If you really want to find out how closely related two organisms are, you've got to get past what they look like. You've got to pop the hood, so to speak, and take a look at their genomes, their genetics, and their biochemistry. That's really the only good way to determine true evolutionary relationships. Then in 1977, something important happened. Well, that was the most important thing that happened to me in 1977. In a laboratory not so far, far away, in fact, across the quad in Burl Hall, Carl Woese was working diligently on a better way to classify living organisms, and he picked a molecule. Technically, the name of it is small subunit ribosomal RNA, or SSRNA. None of that has to mean anything to you right now. But by the time exam two comes around, you will be well-versed in small subunit ribosomal RNA, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Let's just, for today, call it a word that's about 1,500 letters in length. Every organism on the planet has a copy of that word. They're not all spelled the same, though, and that's the key. What we're doing is we're looking for where the differences are in the spelling of that word, the assumption being the more differences there are, the more deviation there is in the evolution of those species. Or, to say it the other way, the fewer differences there are in the spelling, the more closely related the organisms are. And this has nothing to do with what they look like on the outside. This is on the inside. These are nucleic acid molecules, and these letters are sequences. So, again, I don't expect you to understand sequences. What I'm talking about is comparing two things and saying, are they closely related or are they not? If there's a lot of differences, well, those two organisms are not very closely related. And when you do that, for every organism you can get your hands on, and we do, every time somebody discovers a new organism, one of the very first things that they do is sequence the small subunit ribosomal RNA and see where you fit. Who are you most closely related to in terms of the differences in those sequences, those spellings of those 1500-letter words? And Woese's conclusion was that what we had for years and years and years been calling prokaryotes is actually two completely distinct kinds of organisms. He called the first one, the first group, the U bacteria. Remember, U means true. This was the initial name. I put U in parentheses because that part of it has been dropped. In a second, I'll explain why. But the true bacteria are what we had just assumed. Everybody in the world just assumed if you didn't have a nucleus, you were probably a bacterial cell. And that is so not true. But there are a lot of bacteria, and there is not a single sample that has ever been taken from any place on the planet that didn't come back with some bacteria. They can live anywhere. They can live in regular and low-regular frost. They can live in, you know, hospitable environments for humans. They can live in deep-sea thermal vents. They can live in nuclear reactors. There's a species of bacteria... The Earth is a place of life.  Nuclear reactors. There's a species of bacteria called Dinococcus radiodurans. You don't have to write that down. That kind of bacteria is so good at correcting damage to its DNA that it can live and divide inside an active nuclear reactor. It's amazing. You can find bacteria everywhere, the good places and the ugly places. And then what Woese called, initially, he called them the archaebacteria to contrast them with the eubacteria. Now, here's where the terminology changed over time. The terminology itself evolved. Now, instead of calling them eubacteria and archaebacteria, we just dropped the bacteria part of archaebacteria because that was misleading. It made it sound like, well, they're just a different kind of bacteria. They're not a different kind of bacteria. They are their own kind of prokaryote. So now we just call them the archae and the bacteria. Both of them are prokaryotes. The archae tend to be found, there are lots of exceptions to this, tend to be found in extreme environments. There are thermophiles. The phyle as opposed to phobic, right? You know, if you're thermophilic, you love heat. If you're thermophobic, you hate heat. There are thermophiles. There are acidophiles. There are basophiles. There are lots of archae that are found in extreme environments. Some of them can be found in more temperate climates, but for the most part, they tend to be found in regions of the planet that resemble the conditions of early Earth. As I mentioned, some of those. The conclusion that what we have been calling prokaryotes is actually two completely separate groups of organisms was based on the spelling of those RNA molecules. If you look at E. coli, which is a representative bacteria that we're going to return to all semester long, you look at the spelling of that letter in E. coli and an archaeal cell and a human cell, there are fewer differences between the archae and the human than there are between the archae and the bacterium. Yes, please. So the structure of bacteria and archae is similar? Yes. The question is, so the structure of bacteria and archae is similar, there are fewer differences between the archaea and the human than there are between the archaea and the bacterium. Yes, please. Yes, you would be, the question is, so the structure of bacteria and archaea is similar, yes? Yes, you would be hard-pressed without training to look under a microscope at one of those types of organisms and tell me, oh, that's clearly a bacterium, or oh, that's clearly an archaeal cell. No, that's why we were, that's why we were oblivious to the difference for years, until somebody said, hey, you know what, just looking at what it looks like isn't enough to tell me who it's more closely related to. So it's about the sequences, which means we had to revise the whole tree of life. Now, instead of super kingdoms like the Prokaryotes and the Eukaryotes, we now use the domain structure. We still, to this day, use the three domain structure. There are the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukaryotes. And this little green branch right here, maybe I didn't draw this one. I don't know, maybe that one's supposed to show where humans are, I don't know. We're over here in the orange somewhere. Down here at the bottom, that is what is casually referred to as LUCA, the last universal common ancestor. When we were all just starting to be cells in the primordial soup, and everybody was essentially the same, then there was no branching on the tree of life. At one point, there was a major event where some of these brand new cells kind of went this way and did their thing, and the others kind of stayed the same. Well, the ones that have, over time, more or less, just kind of stayed the same are the bacteria. And so here, that's our first branch point. There's some cells that decided to do things a little bit different, and they went over that way, and they continued as a different kind of organism for a long time, and then there was a separate branch. And that's when the archae became different than the eukaryotes, the origin of the nucleus. Not every cell got a nucleus. So that's how you can tell that we are more closely related to the archaea than the archaea are to the bacteria. And I will continue, like I said, to use E. coli as a representative bacteria throughout the entire semester. Yes, that is the one that gives people food poisoning at Jack in the Box on a semi-regular basis. But most E. coli strains are not pathogenic like that. This is a table that I've included in the handouts for you to reflect on. We're not going to go through all of the details of this table, but it is important that you're comfortable with the take-home points in this table. Like the fact that structurally, you would sort of put the archaea and the bacteria together, but biochemically, you would put the archaea and the eukaryotes in the same bigger grouping. Now, I'm not saying that the archaea are any more eukaryotes than they are bacteria. They are their own thing. They're just more closely related to us than they are to the bacteria. So now, switching gears a little bit, it's important to mention that in order to be considered a different species than that species, there have to be some genetic and biochemical differences. If you were the same, you'd be two members of the same species. But no matter what species you are part of, no matter what domain of life you're part of, you are made of one or more cells. Why? Well, I have a textbook answer and a more everyday answer. There's the textbook answer. Let's read it together, shall we? Life requires a structural compartment separate from the external environment in which molecules can perform unique functions in a relatively constant internal environment. That's the textbook answer. What's Brad's answer to why all organisms are made of one or more cells? Because those reactions have to have a place to happen. Life needs a place to live, and that living compartment is called the cell. This allows for separate things to be going on in one species than are going on in another species. The clanging, I noticed many of you are being distracted by the clanging over there. It's almost certainly the heating pipes. Just ignore it. I don't think anybody's trying to disrupt our lecture. It's an old building. All right, so that living compartment is a cell. Once we started to realize that, hey, I think everybody is composed of cells, different scientists started putting together these ideas that we call the cell theory. The cell theory has three basic tenets or pillars. One is that the cell is the fundamental unit of life. If you are not based on a cellular structure, you are not considered a living organism, like viruses, for example. Viruses don't have cellular structure. Another tenet of the cell theory is that the cell is the fundamental unit of life. If you are not based on a cellular structure, you are not considered a living organism. Like viruses, for example. Viruses don't have cellular structure. Another tenet of the cell theory is that all organisms are composed of cells. Some of them are composed of a single cell. Some are composed of multiple cells. E. coli is a single cell. You and I are multicellular beings. But all of us have at the essence of our physical structure, cells. And the third and last tenet of the cell theory is that all cells arise from preexisting cells. That seems kind of obvious in 2024. Back in the 1800s, maybe not so much. Maybe there were theories of spontaneous generation, right? Cells could just spontaneously arise. Well, no, they don't. A cell is a product of a division of a previous cell, okay? So those are the tenets of the cell theory. And cells are small. Why? Why are cells small? Now, in a second, we're gonna address the issue that small is a relative term. MCB 150 is full of relative terms. Small and big, fast and slow, high and low. Always ask yourself, get in the practice of asking yourself, compared to what, Brad? That's what I would hope that you would do. So I say that most cells are small. Small compared to what? Well, compared to an elephant, let's say, but asking yourself, compared to what, Brad? That's what I would hope that you would do. So I say that most cells are small. Small compared to what? Well, compared to an elephant, let's say. But not compared to a hydrogen atom. It's all relative. Small is a very relative term. But in the grand scheme of things, on the scale of life, which we're going to take a look at in just a second, they are fairly small and live within a fairly narrow range. Why? So let's use my elephant example for a second. Why isn't an elephant one gigantic elephant-sized cell? And a snail one snail-sized cell? And a bacteria one bacterial-sized cell? Well, snail, one snail-sized cell, and a bacteria, one bacterial-sized cell. Well, the reason comes down to the surface area to volume ratio. I used that intentionally as a seemingly random example on Wednesday of stuff that you could look up. I knew I was gonna be talking about this two days from then, so I just introduced you already to this idea of a surface area to volume ratio. As you get bigger and bigger and bigger, the surface area to volume ratio decreases. As you get smaller and smaller and smaller, the surface area to volume ratio increases. And here's another sort of semester-long idea. More in biology is not always better. In fact, a lot of times, more is bad. More than the right copy of number of chromosomes is really bad. So don't just assume, well, more means you've got extra. You can, you know, whatever. No. Having a larger surface area to volume ratio is not any better than having a smaller. You know, there's such a thing as having too small or too large. There's a sweet spot. Now, it's a range. Not every cell is the same size, as you can see here. This is a sort of a representation of little cell, big cell. Given the scale that this figure uses, one unit and 10 units, it's not that different than maybe a prokaryotic cell and a eukaryotic cell. I am not at all concerned with the math in this figure. I do not expect anybody to need to calculate surface area to volume ratio. But notice what happens when you go from small to big. The surface area to volume ratio, based on the math, the math does work, is 3 for the small cell. It's 0.3 for the cell that has 10 times the radius as the small cell. So if you increase your radius by 10-fold, then you decrease your surface area to volume by 10 tenfold. That's relevant. Let's talk about what surface area volume ratio means. A cell has to be big enough to support the reactions that make the cell alive. If a cell gets too small, it does have plenty of surface area. So let's also talk about why the surface area is important. The volume allows you to do stuff. The surface area allows you to exchange stuff and communicate with the environment. If you have lots and lots of surface area, it's like having a factory or a room like this. Actually, I'm looking around Folinger right now. Look around Folinger. There's a lot of doors. Imagine that those doors are import-export channels for stuff. If we were a factory in here, if we were all parts of machinery doing work in this factory, we would need to import raw materials, wouldn't we? And we would want to export our products. That's the way a factory works. Bring in the raw materials, do the work in the factory on the factory floor, and then export the products and get rid of the wastes. So there needs to be a balance of, I need plenty of room to do the work, but I also need plenty of doors. I need plenty of places to exchange information and material with the outside world. Now imagine that this cell, this magic folding auditorium, becomes ten times wider, but the number of doors doesn't change. So that's not going to help. Yes, we've got a bigger factory floor, but we don't have as many places to get stuff in and out. We have the capability of doing a lot more work. The volume of the cell, as it gets larger and larger and larger, is physically capable of supporting more reactions. It's just that the surface area doesn't keep up with it. And you have fewer, a smaller increase in surface area than you do in volume. It's like blowing up a balloon. The physical amount of balloon didn't change, but it's getting stretched, even though as you pour or pump or blow more air into there, you're increasing the volume, but there's only so far you can go. So that's why cells don't just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Yes, you'd have more volume, you could do more things, but your surface area doesn't keep up. So what if we took full-length auditorium and shrunk it? Well, and added more doors. That'd be great. We could get more things theoretically in and out, but we're shrinking our floor space and in the process, reducing the amount of work that we'd be capable of doing. So there's a balance, is what I'm saying. Some cells have a surface area to volume ratio of about three, others about 0.3. That's about the extent of it. It doesn't get much bigger than that. There are some exceptions like octopus neurons and things like that, some weird examples out there of really, really big cells. And then there are some super, super small bacterial cells and even some fairly small eukaryotic cells as well. Those are the exceptions. Most cells stay in this range of surface area to volume and hopefully now you appreciate why. Now when we say small, again, I remind you that that's a very relative term. What does that mean? Small on what scale? Well, let's take a look at the scale of life, at least some of the life. Some versions of this figure that I've seen in the past have had like blue whales and California redwoods on one end showing you really, really big things. The point here is that cells exist on this logarithmic scale in a fairly narrow range, that you don't find cells as small as subatomic particles, and you don't find cells as big as human beings. That's because you can't deviate too much from that acceptable surface area to volume ratio. There's a word that I am going to use multiple times this semester, and I'm going to keep changing it up on what it means. The context is going to dictate the definition of the word resolution. In this case right now, resolution is defined as the ability to tell the difference between two things when you're looking at them really close. Resolution means other things as well, but in the context of microscopy, resolution is the ability to differentiate two individual things when you look at them. If you say, and I could hold up pieces of paper that have black dots on them, and I could get them close enough together to where the people in the front row would easily be able to tell, see the white space between them and the people in the back of the balcony, it would just look like one bigger black spot. That's resolution. There's not as much resolution from the back of the balcony as there is the first few rows. You would be able to differentiate the difference between two objects. It's no different with microscopy. With light microscopy, we can see the difference between two objects when looking at them under a microscope at about the boundary of where that yellow is, over on the right. This scale, in case you haven't noticed, is going from big on the left to little on the right. So, little, meaning, you know, here's a meter, about three feet or so. There's a meter. A micron is a millionth of a meter. The little Greek letter M, the Greek letter mu, the lower case, that is one millionth of a meter, or a, you know, it's called a micron, 10 to the minus six meters. So, we can use, most light microscopes can tell the difference down to about 0.2 microns, or 0.2, you know, 10 to the minus six meters. That's really good. That's how we can tell the difference between a couple of different bacterial cells. Bacteria tend to be, you've got a range sort of identified here. This is where most bacteria live. The length or the diameter of most bacteria is about 1 to 10 microns. Eukaryotic cells tend to be 10 to about 100 microns. Again, those are averages. Those are, you know, the common denominator, right? There's exceptions to those. And you can even see down here on this part of the x-axis, we've got labeled some smallest bacteria. And here are some bigger cells. Like an egg is just a single cell that hasn't been fertilized yet. So some of them can get to be pretty big. But most of them are gonna live in this range right here because of that whole surface area volume thing. So the resolving power of light microscopes gets us down where we can see something. We can see nucleus, nuclei, right? Because that's how we identify the kernels. That's how we know the prokaryotes from the eukaryotes. By the way, this is just a tiny tangent. It is acceptable to use the word prokaryote, but be careful because especially around these parts, on this campus, if you're talking to a microbiologist and you use the word prokaryote, they get angry really quick because prokaryote doesn't differentiate the archaea from the bacteria. And the archaea are a really big deal here. There's a sign out in front of Burl Hall that commemorates Woese's discovery, right? Here's another. I'm going to add a tangent to my tangent. He was considered a heretic when he first proposed the three-domain structure. People hated the idea that they had been wrong all along about how organisms were being classified. They refused to believe him. So over the years, lab after lab after lab did everything they could to prove him wrong. And it usually started with trying to pick some other molecule. You know, he used small subunit ribosomal RNAs. He used this word. People tried other words. Well, what if we tried to compare organisms with these other words? I'll bet we could come up with a different tree. And they didn't. All they did was make it extra clear that he was right all along. But it still took decades. I'm not talking about, you know, over winter break, they finally all said, okay, you were right. I'm talking about decades later. It started to finally get in some of the books, the textbooks. Now, you can find even middle school biology books will talk about the archae. And some of them even mentioned woes by name. But boy, did that take a long time. The scientific community was unbelievably reluctant to acknowledge that the prokaryotes weren't all basically the same, especially the magnitude of the difference that he was proposing. So it was a long time later. And because of that, people who study the archy, and there are several of them on our campus, are really on, just, you know, they're ready to pounce if you use the wrong words. They're ready to get in your face and say, no, it's not that way. So all I'm saying is that know your audience. I think most people will acknowledge that, yes, an archie is a prokaryote. It's just one of two kinds of prokaryotes, and that's where you have to be careful. All right, so talked about the resolution of light microscopes. What if I want to see the stuff over on the far right of this figure? Light microscopes aren't going to do it. You're probably going to use more sophisticated technology called electron microscopy, which literally uses electrons bombarding a prepared sample, and then you monitor what gets hit by electrons and where there is space. If there's space, if there's nothing there, then the electron goes through and exposes a piece of photographic film, and you get a picture. If there's something there, there's nothing there, then the electron goes through and exposes a piece of photographic film and you get a picture. If there's something there, the electron hits it, bounces off, and it's like it casts a shadow on the photographic film. So where there's the shadow in electron microscopy, darker equals more. In electron microscopy, I don't have any control over the projector. It's not angled right in the bottom part of this bullet point, got half cut off. But this last bullet point says denser material, the more stuff there is, denser material absorbs more electrons and appears darker. In electron microscopy, darker equals more because you're casting a bigger shadow. There was more stuff there. And notice the difference. And also, this is going to be tough. For some of you that haven't thought about scales and especially logarithmic stuff, we didn't just go from 0.2 to 0.5. We went from 0.2 microns to 0.5 nanometers. That's a thousand-fold difference. A nanometer is a thousand microns. It's not 10 to the sixth meters. It's 10 to the minus sixth meters. It's 10 to the minus ninth meters. A nanometer is a thousand times smaller than a micron or micrometer. So if now, look, we can go all the way down here. It's about halfway. It's not 10 to the 6th meters, it's 10 to the minus 6th meters, it's 10 to the minus 9th meters. A nanometer is a thousand times smaller than a micron or micrometer. So if now look, we can go all the way down here, it's about halfway, it's right in between the one nanometer and the 0.1 nanometer, so we can start seeing the small molecules that we're going to be spending the rest of the semester talking about. And that's where we're going to start on Monday. We're going to start with some basic eukaryotic organelle structure and then start talking about what those things are made of. That's a good place to stop for today. Have a wonderful weekend, everybody. Stay warm if you can Thank you.
