> MCB150 Lecture Transcript Summary

# Introduction
Happy Monday! The lecturer opens the session, expressing hope for a great weekend. The weekend included attending a friend's wedding where two Wi-Fi engineers got married. The reception was fantastic.

# Exam Announcement
The focus shifts to MCB150 course matters, and an important announcement is made regarding the first exam. It's scheduled for next week on Thursday, February 8th, from 7 to 9 p.m. Various rooms will host the exam based on the student's TA, with specific details available on Canvas.

# Semester Pace
The lecturer reminds students about the fast-paced nature of the semester, emphasizing the need to stay on top of the material. They reflect on the quick passage of time in college, urging students to prepare for the upcoming exam.

# Exam Content and Review
Details about the exam content are shared, indicating the last material to be covered on the Monday before the exam. The Wednesday before the exam will offer an optional review session.

# Biological Membranes - Selective Permeability
The lecture then delves into the topic of biological membranes, specifically addressing their selective permeability. The size and charge of molecules influence their ability to pass through the membrane, with emphasis on hydrophobicity and examples of molecules that can easily traverse.

# Biological Membranes - Fluidity
The concept of fluidity in biological membranes is introduced. Membranes are described as fluid, and an experiment of mice and human cells from the 1970s is referenced to demonstrate lipid movement. Lipid movement occurs through spinning, lateral shift, and transverse diffusion, the latter being facilitated by enzymes like flipases.

# Biological Membranes - Fluidity and Stability Balance
The delicate balance between fluidity and stability in biological membranes is discussed. Tail length and saturation levels of phospholipids impact this balance. Shorter tails and increased unsaturation contribute to higher fluidity, while longer tails and reduced unsaturation lead to increased stability.

# Cholesterol's Role
Cholesterol's role in maintaining membrane fluidity and stability is explored. At low temperatures, cholesterol increases fluidity by disrupting interactions. Conversely, at high temperatures, cholesterol enhances stability by restricting movement. Cholesterol acts as an adaptable solution for maintaining membrane properties.

# Question and Answer Session
The lecture concludes with a question and answer session, where students participate in a question related to phospholipids' abundance in organisms living in Antarctica. The answer was shorter carbon chains and more kinks.

# Next Topic Preview
The lecturer concludes by introducing the next topic, nucleic acids, specifying DNA and RNA as the two main types.
