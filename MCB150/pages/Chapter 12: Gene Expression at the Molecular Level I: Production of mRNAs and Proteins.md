> # Mina and Rezzy
> - Mina eats a horse and is always thin as hell. Rezzy has a hard time keeping the weight down
> - Could this be due to environmental factors, like our social perception and our diet and our behaviorial factors?
>   - Perhaps
> - But genetics also has something to do with it, and obesity runs in families
>   - Ancestors gave you Thrifty genes for fat for famines and food scarce times
>   - Great for little food, gives you heart disease with lots of food
> - So know your genes well! They are heritable!
>   - E.g. eye color, colorblindness
> - We lose our minds over how are genes working at the molecular level? How are DNA sequences organized to form genes and how are these genes templates to make RNA copies?
>   - ### HOW IS IT SYNTHESIZING A FUNCTIONAL PROTEIN?!??!?!
> - Thus we learn Gene expression to see how genes function either at the level of traits or the molecular level, with it really just being woven together as expressing genes = affecting structure and function of cells determining organismal traits
> - To start, we see how researchers found that genes store information to make proteins and see each step as to how gene expression occurs at the molecular level.
>   - The steps include:
>     - Use of gene as a template to make an RNA molecule
>     - Modifying RNA into a functional molecule (ONLY IN EUKARYOTES)
>     - Use of RNA to direct the formation of a protein
> - This chapter will focus on the expression of genes coding polypeptides (**protein-coding genes**) and the next chapter will see how some genes produce **non-coding RNAs** (ncRNAs, and they do not encode polypeptides)

> Good luck on this unit. I will rest easy knowing that I will likely fuck it up too.
