# Lecture Transcript: RNA Processing in Eukaryotes

## Opening Remarks
Thank you. Earlier today I was running late for a meeting, and somebody stopped me anyway and said, hey, what's the difference between ignorance and apathy? And I said, look, I don't know and I don't care. Thank you.

## Course Announcements
- Good afternoon. Happy Wednesday to you all. Welcome to MCB 150.
- Exam Reminder: The upcoming exam is a week from tomorrow, Thursday, the 7th of March, from 7 to 9 p.m.
- Deadline for Conflict Exam: Monday at 5 p.m. is the deadline for conflict exam requests.
- Exam Locations: Already posted in Canvas, same as exam one. Show up on time.
- Exam Coverage: Material up to Monday's class will be on exam two.

## Practice Problems and Exam Preparation
- Reminder about practice problems from exam one with metabolism questions. New practice sets for exam two will be available soon.
- Questions: If you have questions, talk to us for clarity on class events and expectations.

## Intron Removal and Exon Joining
When we left off on Monday, we were talking about what intron removal entails. Let's explore how this process occurs with some pictures.

- Introns vary in length, but intron-exon junctions are crucial.
- SNRPs (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes) remove introns and join exons.
- 5' splice site and 3' splice site are identified by SNRPs.
- Introns are looped out, cut at the 5' splice site, and form a lariat structure.
- False splice sites can lead to disorders like thalassemias.

## Alternative Splicing
- Introns provide regulatory capabilities and flexibility for alternative splicing.
- Alternative splicing allows different combinations of exons, creating multiple protein variants.
- The average in humans is three to four different versions of a protein due to alternative splicing.

## Relationship Between Genome Size and Complexity
- Genome size doesn't directly correlate with organism complexity.
- Prokaryotes show a linear relationship between genome size and the number of genes.
- Eukaryotes, like humans and rice, exhibit a scatterplot with no clear correlation.
- Alternative splicing contributes to the diversity of proteins despite variations in genome size.

## mRNA Processing
### 5' End Modification
- The 5' end receives a cap structure: 5' 7-methylguanosine cap.
- Cap structure protects against exonucleases, aids ribosome recognition, and provides directionality.

### 3' End Modification
- Poly-A tail added to the 3' end by poly-A polymerase.
- The poly-A tail protects against exonucleases and serves as a recognition site for translation.
