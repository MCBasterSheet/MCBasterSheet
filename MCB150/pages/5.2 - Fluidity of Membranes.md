> Although a membrane provides a critical interface between a cell/organelle and its environment, it is not solid. It has properties of fluidity, meaning all individual molecules are in close association but can readily move in the membrane. We analyze this property this section.

# Membranes Are Semifluid
  - More appropriate to call them semifluid as the movement of the membrane only occurs in two dimensions
  -   Phospholipids can only rotate around their long axes and move lateralyl within the membrane leaflet
  - Image showing how The lipid bilayer only moves in two dimensions, that being rotating itself, moving right and left along the bilayer, and flipping to the other side via flippas

  - Rotational and lateral movements keep the tail in the hydrophobic internior making them energetically favorable
      - At 37C a lipid molecule can exchange places with its neighbor around 10^7 times per second, moving several micrometers per second
      - The lipid can traverse a bacterial cell in 1 second and a animal cell in 10-20 seconds
  - The flip flops from one leaflet to the opposite doesn't occur spontaneously
      - It is not energetically favorable as the heads have to go to the hydrophobic interior
      - To Flip, the lipids need flippase and ATP to flip them
    - While most lipids diffuse rotationally and laterally, they found that certain lipids in animal cells tend to strongly associate with each other in **lipid rafts**, a group of lipids floating together as a unit within a larger sea of lipids
      - They have a composition of high amounts of cholesterol, lipid-anchored proteins, and transmembrane proteins
      - The function is still being researched, but it is important in endocytosis and cell signaling
     
# Lipid Composition Affects Membrane Fluidity
>The biochemical properties of phospholipids affect fluidity of the phospholipid bilayer

## Length of Phospholipid Tails
  - Lipid tail lengths, ranging from 14-24 carbon atoms, with 16-18 being most common, affect membrane fluidity
  - Longer tails have stronger van der Waals dispersion forces and make the membrane less fluid
  - Shorter tails are less likely to interact with one another, making it more fluid
    - Shorter tails allow transmembrane proteins to move easily within the plane of the membrane
## Double Bonds in Phospholipid Tails
  - Another important part is double bonds in lipid tails
  - When a double bond is present, the lipid is unsaturated due to the lack of hydrogens bound to carbon atoms
  - It also makes a kink in the lipid tail, so it is more difficult for tails to interact
## Cholesterol
  - It is a short and rigid molecule made by animal cells
    - Plant cells have phytosterols
  - Cholesterol stabilize membranes, and its effects depend on temperature
    - In hotter temperatures, cholesterol makes the membrane less fluid
    - At lower temperatures, cholesterol makes the membrane more fluid to prevent freezing
  - This optimal fluidity is essential for cell life
    - If a membrane is too fluid, it is leaky
    - If too solid, the functioning of membrane proteins is inhibited
  - The way organisms cope with temperature change is by altering lipid compositions in their membranes.
    - E.g. when cold, certain fish incorporates more cholesterol into their membranes
    - If a plant cell has higher temperatures, they will have longer lipid tails and fewer double bonds
# Many Transmembrane Proteins Can Rotate and Move Laterally, but Some Are Restricted in Their Movement
  - Many transmembrane proteins rotate and move laterally throughout the plane of a membrane
    - As they are larger, transmembrane proteins move within the membrane at a slower rate
    - They also cannot flip flop as they have hydrophilic regions poking outside the phospholipid biyaler
  - 1970, Larry Frye and Michael Edidin conducted an experiment verifying the lateral movement of transmembrane proteins
    - Mouse + human cells were mixed and fused with agents
    - Some cooled to 0C, others to 37C.
    - Both cells were exposed to fluorescent antibodies to target mouse transmembrane protein
      -   It was observed under a microscope, and cells at 0C, temp to inhibit lateral movement, fluoresced only on one side of the cell
      -   But if they incubated instead, it fluoresced across the entire cell
      -   More heat = more movement
  - Not all transmembrane proteins can rotate and do lateral movement
    - Depending on the cell type, 10-70% of the membrane proteins may be restrcited in their movement
    - Transmembrane proteins could be bound to components of the cytoskeleton, restrcting proteins from moving
    - Or they are attached to molecules outside the cell
      - E.g. Extracellular matrix of animal cells
    - Image below is the attachment of transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleeton and ECM of an animal cell, thus restricting movement
