> # Learning Goals
> 1. See how the results of an experiment verified ATP synthase uses H+ gradients to make ATP
> 2. Describe the Structure of ATP synthase
> 3. Explain how a series of three conformational changes enables ATp synthase to make ATP
> 4. Analyze the results showing how ATP synthase is a rotary machine
>
> The structure and function of ATP synthase is weirdly complex. This section covers the experiments that uncovered the function of ATP synthase and explored in greater depth how it makes ATP.
