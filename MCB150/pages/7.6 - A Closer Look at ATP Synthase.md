# Experiments with Purified Proteins in Membrane Vesicles Verified Chemiosmosis
- How would one purify the enzyme and study its function into Vitro?
- 1974 Efraim Racker and Walther Stoeckenius purified ATP synthase and anothe protein called bacteriorhodopsin (foudn in Archaea)
- Previous studies found bacteriorhdoopsin to be a light-driven H+ pump
- Put them into membrane vesicles (reconstitution)
- ATP synthase facing one way, Bacteriorhdopsin the other
- Lights off, no ATP
- Lights on, INSANE ATP
- Convinced the researchers ATP synthase needs the H+ gradient

> # Core Concept
> Was the ETC always needed to make ATP via ATP synthase
> No Because all ATP synthase needs is a H+ gradient

# ATP synthase is a Rotary Machine Making ATP as it Spins
- It can spin. And it is made of many proteins
- The region inside the membrane has three subunits, a, b, c
  - 10-14 c's made the ring in the membrane
  - One a subunit is bound to this ring
  - Two b subunits are attached to the a subunit and protrudes from the membrane
- The nonmembrane-embedded subuntis are designated with Greek letters, ε, δ, γ
  - ε, γ bind to the ring of c subunits
  - γ subunits make a long stalk going upwards into the center of another run of three a and three β subunits
  - The β subunits contains the catalytic site where ATP is made
  - δ subunits form a connection between the ring of α and β subunits and the two b subunits
