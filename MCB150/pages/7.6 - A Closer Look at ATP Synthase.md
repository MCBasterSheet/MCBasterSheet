# Experiments with Purified Proteins in Membrane Vesicles Verified Chemiosmosis
- How would one purify the enzyme and study its function into Vitro?
- 1974 Efraim Racker and Walther Stoeckenius purified ATP synthase and anothe protein called bacteriorhodopsin (foudn in Archaea)
- Previous studies found bacteriorhdoopsin to be a light-driven H+ pump
- Put them into membrane vesicles (reconstitution)
- ATP synthase facing one way, Bacteriorhdopsin the other
- Lights off, no ATP
- Lights on, INSANE ATP
- Convinced the researchers ATP synthase needs the H+ gradient

> # Core Concept
> Was the ETC always needed to make ATP via ATP synthase
> No Because all ATP synthase needs is a H+ gradient

# ATP synthase is a Rotary Machine Making ATP as it Spins
- It can spin. And it is made of many proteins
- The region inside the membrane has three subunits, a, b, c
  - 10-14 c's made the ring in the membrane
  - One a subunit is bound to this ring
  - Two b subunits are attached to the a subunit and protrudes from the membrane
- The nonmembrane-embedded subuntis are designated with Greek letters, ε, δ, γ, β, α
  - ε, γ bind to the ring of c subunits
  - γ subunits make a long stalk going upwards into the center of another run of three a and three β subunits
  - The β subunits contains the catalytic site where ATP is made
  - δ subunits form a connection between the ring of α and β subunits and the two β subunits

> ## The synthesis of ATP involves a mechanical rotation of a portion of ATP synthase
> - The rotation is caused by the movement of H+ ions from the intermembrane space into the matrix
> - One at a time, H+ ions move through a half-channel in the a subunit and binds to the c subunit (THIS IS THE RED ARROW)
> - An H+ ion bound to an adjacent c subunit is released and travels through a half-channel in the a subunit into the matrix (THIS IS THE BLUE ARROW)
> - Binding an release of H+ ions cause the ring of c subunits to rotate clockwise
> - The ε and γ subunits, on top of the ring of c subunits, also rotate as the ring turns

## How Does Rotation Promote ATP synthesis?
- The other components of ATP synthase, including a, b, δ, α, β subunits do not rotate
- Each time the γ subunit rotates 120 degrees, it changes its contact with three β subunits casuing conformation changes
- These conformational changes promote ATP synthesis because it favors ATP synthesis and release
- The conformational changes happen in this order
  - 1. ADP and Pi bind with good affinity
    2. ADP and Pi bind very tightly, straining chemical bonds so ATP is made
    3. ATP binds weakly and is released

>
> Each time the γ subunit rotates, it causes β subunits to change to the next conformation
> After 3 conformations, we return to conformation 1 and we can continue ATP synthesis
>
> This was all proposed by American Paul Boyer
> Skeptical because how could an enzyme spin?
> Supported by finding three β subunits with different conformations when analyzing the nonmembrane-embedded portion of ATP synthase


# Yoshida and Kinosita Demonstrated That the γ Subunit of ATP Synthase Spins
- These two wanted to experimentally visualize the rotary nature of ATP synthase
- They released membrane-embedded region with salt giving them one γ, three α and three β subunits
- They then adhered the one γ, three α and three β subunits complex to a glass slide so the γ protruded upwards
- Then they tied a long fluorescently labeled actin filament to the γ subunit via linker proteins and thus let them use a fluorescene microscope to see

- Now without a membrane, how did they get it to still spin?
  - They add ATP and ATP synthase can act backwards and hydrolyze ATP
  - So when researchers added ATP, they found the actin filament rotating in a counter clockwise direction
  - Opposite direction btw than when forming ATP
