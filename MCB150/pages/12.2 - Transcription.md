> # Learning Goals
> 1. Give molecular definition of the term Gene
> 2. Outline the three stages of transcription and the role of RNA polymerase in this process
> 3. Explain how genes within the same chromosome vary in direction of transcription
> 4. Compare and contrast transcription in bacteria and eukaryotes
>
> DNA stores information. To express genes, the information must be accessed on the molecular level. Instead of directly accessing the DNA directly, they instead use RNA via transcription where DNA sequence is copied into a RNA sequence. Transcription doesn't alter the structure of DNA, so the same DNA can store as more RNA is being made. Here, we see the steps that genes take to be transcriptional units. We also see the differences Bacteria and Eukaryotes have here.

# At the Molecular Level, a Gene is Transcribed and Produces a Functional Product
> Gene: An organized unit of base sequences that enables a segment of DNA to be transcribed into RNA resulting in the formation of a functional product
