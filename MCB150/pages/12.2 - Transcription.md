> 1. Give molecular definition of the term Gene

> 3. Explain how genes within the same chromosome vary in direction of transcription
> 4. Compare and contrast transcription in bacteria and eukaryotes

> DNA stores information. To express genes, the information must be accessed on the molecular level. Instead of directly accessing the DNA directly, they instead use RNA via transcription where DNA sequence is copied into a RNA sequence. Transcription doesn't alter the structure of DNA, so the same DNA can store as more RNA is being made. Here, we see the steps that genes take to be transcriptional units. We also see the differences Bacteria and Eukaryotes have here.

# At the Molecular Level, a Gene is Transcribed and Produces a Functional Product
> Gene: An organized unit of base sequences that enables a segment of DNA to be transcribed into RNA resulting in the formation of a functional product

- When protein-coding genes are transcribed, an mRNA is made that specifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide.
- After being made, the polypeptide becomes a function product, where one or more become a functional protein
- The mRNA is an intermediary in polypeptide synthesis,
- Most genes are protein-coding genes
- For some genes, the functional product is the RNA, a non-coding RNA that is never translated
- There are two important examples of non-coding RNA
  - Transfer RNA (tRNA) translates the language of mRNA into amino acids
  - Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) forms part of ribosomes, providing the site of translation
  - We cover more later in the chapter
- A gene is composed of specific base sequences organized in a way that allows DNA to be transcribed into RNA
  - The image below shows the organization of sequences in a protein-coding gene
  - The **Promoter** is a sequence of DNA that controls when are where transcription will begin
  - The **Terminator** specifies the end of transcription
  - Transcription occurs between the two areas, where DNA is transcribed into mRNA from the end of the promoter through the coding sequence to the terminator
  - This transcribed region is the information that specifies amino acid sequence of a polypeptide when mRNA is translated

- Other DNA sequences are involved in the regulation of transcription
- These **Regulatory Sequences** function as sites for binding regulatory proteins, discussed in Chapter 14
  - When regulatory proteins bind to a regulatory sequence, the rate of transcription is affected
  - Some enhance, some inhibit rate of transcription
