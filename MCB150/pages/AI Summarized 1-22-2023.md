Because we've established that all life has to happen within the construct of a cell. So let's explore a cell from the outside. Many cells on Earth have cell walls, separating them from their environment. Prokaryotic cells, like bacteria, and plant cells have cell walls. However, animal cells, like ours, lack cell walls, allowing for various shapes.

A cell wall, though limiting shapes, offers protection. Every cell, with or without a cell wall, has a plasma membrane. Why? To maintain consistent internal chemistry. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable, regulating the passage of substances. It also facilitates communication between cells and aids in cell identification.

Moving to prokaryotes, like bacteria, lacking organelles and a nucleus, electron microscopy reveals their basic structure. Some bacteria have capsules on their outer layer, providing stickiness, aiding in attacks or preventing dehydration. Capsules are not essential for survival but serve specific purposes.

Inside a bacterial cell, electron microscopy shows the nucleoid, containing genetic material, and ribosomes, essential for protein synthesis. Prokaryotes are simple and small, limited in complexity. To increase complexity, eukaryotic cells have organelles, like the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus.

The nucleus, separated by a double membrane (nuclear envelope), maintains and replicates the genome, initiates DNA replication, transcribes RNA, and produces ribosomes in the nucleolus. Mitochondria, the cell's powerhouse, generates ATP.

The rough ER, with ribosomes, initiates protein synthesis and modification. Smooth ER synthesizes lipids and detoxifies harmful substances. The Golgi apparatus acts as the cell's post office, modifying proteins and directing them to specific destinations.

Ribosomes, essential for protein synthesis, can be free-floating or bound to the ER. Polysome formation allows multiple ribosomes to work simultaneously, streamlining protein production.

Understanding these components helps answer application-based questions. For instance, if a person lacks lactose-digesting enzymes in intestinal cells, the dysfunctional organelle is likely the rough ER, responsible for protein secretion.

We are delving into the fascinating world of cells, membranes, and organelles, exploring the intricate components that constitute them. Our focus is on four significant biological polymers, also known as macromolecules. While the term macromolecule is generally applicable, it's more accurately defined as identical types of monomers linked together uniformly. Not all of the large biological polymers conform to this description.

First on our journey are proteins. They play a crucial role in cellular structure and function. Nucleic acids, encompassing genomic materials and RNAs, are next in line. Carbohydrates, specifically polysaccharides, come into play. Carbohydrates, a versatile term including sugars, have diverse functions, such as energy storage and structural support. Finally, we explore lipids, with a special mention that fats are a subset of lipids, and various types contribute to cellular composition.

Considering the composition of cells, water takes the lead, constituting about 70% of a typical bacterial cell. The remaining components, excluding water, are dominated by macromolecules, comprising approximately a quarter of the cell's total weight. While water holds the majority, macromolecules shape the cellular landscape.

Visualizing this breakdown graphically, we observe a significant blue portion representing water. Beyond water, the red segment, denoting macromolecules, dominates. Further zooming into this red segment, we unveil the hierarchy of macromolecules—proteins claiming the largest share by dry weight, followed by nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.

Transitioning to the construction process, macromolecules are formed through condensation reactions, also known as dehydration synthesis. These reactions involve linking similar building blocks in a consistent manner to evolve from monomers to polymers. Amino acids construct proteins, nucleotides build nucleic acids, monosaccharides form polysaccharides, and specific arrangements of fatty acids and glycerol create lipids.

The reversibility of condensation reactions is essential for dynamic cellular processes. Hydrolysis reactions facilitate the breakdown of macromolecules by introducing water, allowing the reverse of condensation—a process vital for cellular flexibility.

Embarking on a detailed exploration of the four major polymers, we commence with carbohydrates. Polysaccharides emerge from condensation reactions connecting monosaccharides. The intricate covalent bonds resulting from these connections will be explored further.

Carbohydrates serve three primary functions: energy storage, structural support (seen in exoskeletons and cell walls), and molecular recognition. The latter involves the use of different carbohydrates on cell surfaces as markers, facilitating cellular interactions.

While the term "carbohydrate" is inclusive, it lacks precision due to its application to both individual sugars and large biological polymers. For specificity, the term "polysaccharide" is recommended when referring to large biological polymers made of individual glucose molecules.

The general formula of a carbohydrate reflects a balance of carbons and twice the number of hydrogens and oxygens. Representing three-dimensional structures on a two-dimensional surface requires creative approaches, such as ring structures. Conventions for naming and numbering these structures are established to aid recognition.

Diving into glucose, a hexose sugar, we explore its ring and straight chain forms. The spontaneous circularization of glucose results in alpha and beta configurations, distinguished by the position of the hydrogen at C1—above the ring for alpha glucose and below the ring for beta glucose.

Concluding our exploration, we touch upon isomers, emphasizing how subtle differences in hydrogen positioning lead to distinct biological properties. Aldose and ketose sugars are introduced, highlighting the significance of carbonyl groups in defining these categories.

As we delve deeper into the intricate world of cellular components, this foundation on macromolecules and carbohydrates sets the stage for a comprehensive understanding of cellular structure and function.
