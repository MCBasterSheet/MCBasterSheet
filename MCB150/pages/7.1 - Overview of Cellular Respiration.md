## Breakdown of glucose in a Eukaryotic Celli n the presence of Oxygen:
- Certain Covalent bonds iwthin glucose store a large amount of chemical ptoential energy
- If glucose is broken via oxidation down to CO2 and Water, a lot of energy is released, with some lost as heat.
  - In our case, we got ATP, NADH, and FADH2
- How? Easy:
    1. Glycolysis
    2. The Breakdown of Pyruvate
    3. The Citric Acid Cycle
    4. Oxidative Phosphorylation
 
# Glycolysis
- Here, glucose is broken down to two pyruvates
- This creates two a net yield of Two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules
- Occurs in Cytoplasm for Eukaryotes
- These ATP molecules are synthesized via substrate-level phosphorylation
  - Occurs when enzyume directly transfer a phosphate from a phosphorylated organic molecule to ADP
    - This is called that because the phosphorylated organic molecule and ADP bind to the enzyme and are the enzyme's substrates
    - ADP b ecomes phosphorylated to form ATP
   
# Breakdown of Pyruvate to an Acetyl Group
- Eukaryotes have 2 pyruvates molecules enter the mitochondrial matrix
- Each one is broken to an acetyl group (2 carbons) and one Carbon Dioxide molecule.
- Each pyruvate is broken down via oxidation, and results in an NADH molecule and made by the reduction of NAD+

# Citric Acid Cycle
- Each Acetyl group is then incorporated into an organic molecule, later oxidized to form two Carbon Dioxide molecules
- One ATP, 3 NADH, and one FADH2 is made in this process
- Two acetyl groups result in four CO2, 2 ATP from substrate level phosphoryllation, six NADH, and two FADH2
- All this is in the mitochondrial matrix

# Oxidative Phosphorylation
- NADH + FADH2 have high energy elections to be readily transferred
- Removal of these electrons release energy, and this energy is harnessed to produce an H+ electrochemical gradient
- Chemiosmosis has energy stored in H+ electrochemical gradient to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic Phosphate
- Oxidative b/c NADH and FADH2 is being oxidized and ADP is phosphorylated to ATP
- Eukaryotes have oxidative phosphorylation occuring in the cristae
 - Projections formed by the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane
 - They increase surface area of the inner membrane and incdreases the amount of ATP to be made
- Bacteria and Archaea have Oxidative Phosphoryllation occur along the plasma membrane.
