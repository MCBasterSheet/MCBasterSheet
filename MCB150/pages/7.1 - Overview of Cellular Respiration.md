> With oxygen, we got aerobic repsiration, and O2 is consumed while Carbon Dioxide is released via Oxidation of organic Molecules
> Respiration is also an act of breathing because of the way we exhale Carbon Dioxide as a by porduct

## Breakdown of glucose in a Eukaryotic Celli n the presence of Oxygen:
- Certain Covalent bonds iwthin glucose store a large amount of chemical ptoential energy
- If glucose is broken via oxidation down to CO2 and Water, a lot of energy is released, with some lost as heat.
  - In our case, we got ATP, NADH, and FADH2
- How? Easy:
    1. Glycolysis
    2. The Breakdown of Pyruvate
    3. The Citric Acid Cycle
    4. Oxidative Phosphorylation
 
# Glycolysis
- Here, glucose is broken down to two pyruvates
- This creates two a net yield of Two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules
- Occurs in Cytoplasm for Eukaryotes
- These ATP molecules are synthesized via substrate-level phosphorylation
  - Occurs when enzyume directly transfer a phosphate from a phosphorylated organic molecule to ADP
    - This is called that because the phosphorylated organic molecule and ADP bind to the enzyme and are the enzyme's substrates
    - ADP b ecomes phosphorylated to form ATP
   
# Breakdown of Pyruvate to an Acetyl Group
