> - Practice exam problems provided, with a caution about the coverage of different semesters.

> ## Protein Organization: Secondary Structure
> - Recap of previous lecture about protein organization.
> - Importance of protein shape in carrying out functions.
> - Analogy of a ball of string and the need for biomolecular stabilizing forces.
> - Introduction to hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding as stabilizing forces.
> - Focus on secondary structure and its significance.
> - Example of keratin, the protein in hair, and the role of alpha helical structure.
> - Discussion on the uniqueness of prion proteins, their misfolding, and infectious nature.

> ## Protein Misfolding and Disease
> - Prion diseases and the challenge in understanding and addressing them.
> - Cascade effect of protein misfolding leading to various problems.
> - Consequences of misfolded proteins, especially in the context of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.
> - Implications for lung problems, breathing difficulties, and potential fatality.

> ## Conclusion
> - Emphasis on the importance of the linear sequence in protein structure determination.
> - Acknowledgment of covered material and anticipation for the next lecture.

> ## Tertiary Structure and Stabilizing Forces
> - Introduction to tertiary structure, the final three-dimensional shape of a protein.
> - Discussion on the chemical participation of R groups in tertiary structure.
> - Various stabilizing forces including hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide linkages.
> - Visualization of a protein's tertiary structure with hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic clusters, ionic bonds, and disulfide linkages.

> ## Water's Role and Protein Diversity
> - Recognition of water as a crucial factor influencing protein structure.
> - Explanation of how water affects the positioning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions in a protein.
> - Diversity in protein shapes, from globular to rod-shaped, with examples of rich alpha helical or beta sheet structures.

> ## Exam-Like Question
> - Addressing a student's question about the maximum number of disulfide bonds in a polypeptide with three cysteines.
> - Clarification that, within a single polypeptide chain, only one disulfide bond can form due to the need for two cysteines.
