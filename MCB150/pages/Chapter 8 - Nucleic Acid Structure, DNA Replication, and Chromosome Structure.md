> 10-17-2001 Mario was out of prison and was convicted of a shit load of things until they used DNA evidence that Edwin M was the real crime committer
> He committed another crime and they matched his DNA
> DNA is the genetic material that provides the blueprint to produce an individual's traits. it is unique, with even identical twins showing minor differences
> This chapter is the molecular level of understanding to understand the further levels
> We see molecular features of DNA, how it stores information, and how it is copied
> We also see RNA and its similarities to DNA and then the molecular compositions of chromosomes where DNA is found (maybe not)
