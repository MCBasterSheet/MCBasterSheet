> # Biology Believes Structure Determines Function
> - If biologists want to understand function molecularly or cellularly, they check biochemical structure
>   - This was also applied to how DNA stores information
> - DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, poylmers consisting of Nucleotides are responsible for storage, expression, and transmission of genetic information
>   - This term came from the discovery of DNA by Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher in 1869
>   - He found phosphorus containing substance from teh nuclei of white blood cells found in waste surgical bandages
>   - He named it nueclein and then as DNA and RNA became more better understood, they found acidic molecules (release H+) in solution with an et negative charge at a neutral pH, thus **Nucleic Acids**
> - DNA is a large macromolecules composed of smaller building blocks, and we consider it at these 5 levels:
>     1. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA
>     2. A strand of DNA is formed by the covalent linkage of nucleotides in a linear manner
>     3. Two strands of DNA hydrogen-bond with each other to make double helixes. In DNA, double helixes are two DNA strands twisted around one another to form a structure resembling a spiral staircase
>     4. In living Cells, DNA is associated with an array of different proteins forming chromosomes. The association of proteins with DNA organizaes the long double helix in a compact structure
>     5. A genome is the complete complement of an organism's genetic material. E.g.  the genome of DNA is a single circular chromosome while eukaryotic cells have DNA in their nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts

# Nucleotides Contain a Phosphate, a Sugar, and a Base
- 3 Components:
  - 1. Phosphate group
    2. Pentose sugar
    3. Nitrogen-containing base
- Nucleotides in DNA and RNA contain different sugars (deoxyribose DNA, ribose DNA)
- Five different bases, purines and pyrimidines
  - Purines adenine and guanine (Purine Double Ring)
  - Pyrimidine Thymine Cytosine Uracil (single-ring)
  - Adenine,guanine, and cytosone are found in both DNA and RNA
  - Thymin is in DNA and Uracil in RNA
- Image of the Purines and Pyrimidines

- A numbering system describes carbon/nitrogen locations
  - Prime for carbons in the sugar
- The atoms in the ring structures of the base are not given the prime designation
  - Sugars is 1` to 5 in a clockwise direction starting with the carbon to the right of the Oxygen
  - Ribose got an oxygen at 2` compared to deoxyribose
- Diagram of the numbering system:

# A Strand is a Linear Linkage of Nucleotides with Directionality
- Next level of nucleic acid structure is the formation of a DNA or RNA strand where nucleotides are covalently attached to each other in a linear fashion
- Image below shows a short strand of DNA with four nucleotides
  - The linkage is a phosphoester bond (a covalent bond between phosphorus and oxygen) with a sugar molecule in one nucleotide and a phosphate group in the next nucleotide
  - Phosphate group connects the two sugar molecules, and from this perspective, linkage in DNA and RNA strands is the phosphodiester linkage with two phosphoester bonds
  - The phosphates and sugar molecules form the backbone of a DNA or RNA strand, and the bases project form the backbone
    - The backbone is negatively charged duet ot he negative charges of the phosphate groups
- An Important structural feature of a DNA strand is the orentation of the nucleotides
- Each phosphate in a phosphodiester linkage is covalently linked to the 5` carbon in one nucleotide to the 3 prime carbon in the other
- In a strand, all sugar molecules are oriented the same direction
  - As shown below, all 5` carbon in sugars are above the 3 prime carbon
  - Strands thus have **directionality** based on the orientation of the sugar molecules within that strand
  - In th eimage, the direction of the strand is said to the be 5` to 3 prime when going top to bottom
  - The 5` end being a phosphate group and the 3 prime having a hydroxide group (alcohol)
- From a perspective of function, DNA and RNA structures have a strand containing a specific sequence of bases.
  - In the photo below, the sequence of bases is T-A C-G
  - To indicate direction, it is 5`-TACG-3prime
  - As they are connected to each other via stable covalent bonds, the sequence of bases in a DNA strand remains the sam eover time, except in rare mutations
  - The sequence of bases in DNA and RNA is the critical feature that lets the nucleic Acids store and transmit information
