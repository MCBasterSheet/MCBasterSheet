> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Outline structural features of DNA at five levels of complexity
> 2. Descdribe the structures of nucleotides, a DNA strand, and the DNA double helix
>
> # Biology Believes Structure Determines Function
> - If biologists want to understand function molecularly or cellularly, they check biochemical structure
>   - This was also applied to how DNA stores information
> - DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, poylmers consisting of Nucleotides are responsible for storage, expression, and transmission of genetic information
>   - This term came from the discovery of DNA by Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher in 1869
>   - He found phosphorus containing substance from teh nuclei of white blood cells found in waste surgical bandages
>   - He named it nueclein and then as DNA and RNA became more better understood, they found acidic molecules (release H+) in solution with an et negative charge at a neutral pH, thus **Nucleic Acids**
> - DNA is a large macromolecules composed of smaller building blocks, and we consider it at these 5 levels:
>     1. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA
>     2. A strand of DNA is formed by the covalent linkage of nucleotides in a linear manner
>     3. Two strands of DNA hydrogen-bond with each other to make double helixes. In DNA, double helixes are two DNA strands twisted around one another to form a structure resembling a spiral staircase
>     4. In living Cells, DNA is associated with an array of different proteins forming chromosomes. The association of proteins with DNA organizaes the long double helix in a compact structure
>     5. A genome is the complete complement of an organism's genetic material. E.g.  the genome of DNA is a single circular chromosome while eukaryotic cells have DNA in their nucleus, mitochondria, and chloroplasts
