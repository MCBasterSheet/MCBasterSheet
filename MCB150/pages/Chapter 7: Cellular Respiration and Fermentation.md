> # Cellular Respiration is the metabolic reactions that a cell uses to get Energy from Food
> We are a controlled reaction, and we lack the fire and the enormous heat happening in a short amount of time
> Extreme control is shown by the cells in their chemical reactions
> With oxygen, and without oxygen, cells find ways to turn glucose into energy
