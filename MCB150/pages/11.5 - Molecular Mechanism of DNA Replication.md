# DNA Replication Begins at an Origin of Replication
- An **Origin of Replication** is the site within a chromosome that serves as a starting point for DNA replication.
  - At the origin, the two DNA strands Unwind, and DNA replication proceeds outwards from two replication forks in a bidirectional replication

*Note for bitch asses: Ori is Origin of Replication*

- **The number of Ori's varies among different organisms**
  - Bacteria, having small circular chromosome, has a single origin of replication
  - Bidirectional replication starts at the Ori and proceeds until the new strand meet on the opposite side of the chromosome
- Eukaryotes have larger chromosomes that are linear, and with multiple Oris, DNA can be replicated in a reasonable about of time
  - The new strands eventually make contact with each other to complete the replication process

# DNA Replication Requires the Action of Several Different Proteins
- DNA replication happens from the Ori, called the DNA Replication Fork
- **All living species has several different proteins involved in this process**
- An understanding of the functions of these proteins is critical to explaining the replication process at the molecular level
## *Helicase, Topoisomerase, and Single-Strand Binding Proteins: Formation and Movement of the Replication Fork*
- To even act as a template for DNA replication, the strands of double helix must separate so the fork must move
- The Ori serves as a site where this separation initially occurs
- The Strand separation at each fork then moves outwards from the enzyme **DNA helicase**
  - At each fork, DNA helicase binds to one of the DNA strands and travels in the 5` to three prime direction towards teh fork
  - Using ATP as energy to break the H-bonds between base pairs, they can separate the DNA strands and keep the fork moving forward
  - The actions of DNA helicase causes knots (supercoils) to form ahead. These knots are removed by **DNA Topoisomerase** (Aka DNA gyrase)
- After the two template DNA strands have separated, they must remain that way until the daughter strands have been made
- The function of **Single-strand binding proteins** is to coat both of the single strands of DNA and prevent them from re-forming a double helix
  - Keeping them exposed makes sure that we are able to keep templates for the synthesis of complementary strands
