# DNA Replication Begins at an Origin of Replication
- An **Origin of Replication** is the site within a chromosome that serves as a starting point for DNA replication.
  - At the origin, the two DNA strands Unwind, and DNA replication proceeds outwards from two replication forks in a bidirectional replication

*Note for bitch asses: Ori is Origin of Replication*

- The number of Ori's varies among different organisms
  - Bacteria, having small circular chromosome, has a single origin of replication
  - Bidirectional replication starts at the Ori and proceeds until the new strand meet on the opposite side of the chromosome
- Eukaryotes have larger chromosomes that are linear, and with multiple Oris, DNA can be replicated in a reasonable about of time
  - The new strands eventually make contact with each other to complete the replication process

# DNA Replication Requires the Action of Several Different Proteins
- DNA replication happens from the Ori, called the DNA Replication Fork
- All living species has several different proteins involved in this process
- An understanding of the functions of these proteins is critical to explaining the replication process at the molecular level
