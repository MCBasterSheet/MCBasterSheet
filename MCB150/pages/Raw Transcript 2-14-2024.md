 Thank you. I mentioned a couple of days ago that this week I've been reflecting on some past relationships. My ex-wife once told me that she thought I was immature. I said fine, you're no longer welcome in my fort. Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Valentine's Day to you all, and welcome to MCB 150. Those of you who have someone to celebrate Valentine's Day with, good for you. Happy, and I hope you have a wonderful day. Those of you that may not, I want to share a couple of my favorite sort of anti-Valentine memes with you. One of them is a more science-y one, the other one is basically just another dad joke. So, everyone can enjoy Valentine's Day today, whether you are... in that spirit or not. So yes, happy Valentine's Day to all of you. Now, let's get back into some science, some metabolism, and let's essentially review in a couple of bullet points what we've done so far. We have been following the molecules and the energy in the food that we eat, specifically glucose molecules, in the hopes of squeezing as much energy out of them as possible. So let's talk about the molecules themselves, the atoms. So let's talk about the molecules themselves, the atoms. We're trying to trace the carbons and the hydrogens, aren't we? The carbons start out in a six-carbon molecule called glucose. It gets fed through glycolysis. What comes out the other end of glycolysis is two molecules of pyruvate. All six of those carbons are still in those two molecules of pyruvate. Then we go into Krebs cycle, and now, through phase two, a combination of pyruvate oxidation and Krebs cycle, we end up getting out six molecules of carbon dioxide. So we've accounted for that carbons. through the Krebs cycle and pyruvate oxidation. Then we go into phase three, and in doing electron transport, we ultimately get all of our hydrogens turned into water molecules with the help of our terminal electron acceptor oxygen forming water. So that's where the molecules go. That's where the atoms go, the carbons and the hydrogens. That's useful, it's important, but what we really want to trace is where does the energy go? The energy. We're not in this to make carbon dioxide and water. We're in this to make ATP. So where did the energy go that ultimately gives us ATP? Well, we started out by doing some substrate-level phosphorylation reactions. We had one of those in glycolysis. We've got one of those in Krebs cycle. That gives us some ATP. But realistically, what do we spend most of our usable energy doing? Reducing cofactors. Taking NAD+, reducing it into NADH, taking FAD, reducing it into FADH2. We gave some other molecule our energy in the hopes that in the end, the payoff will be worth it. And it is worth it. It is much more efficient to use the intermediate cofactors than to directly synthesize ATP. If you have a reaction, a singular reaction, that you can make into a substrate-level phosphorylation reaction, then for every one of those substrate molecules that gets converted into product, you get one ATP. That's great. But for every NAD+, you can reduce into NADH, you can theoretically get three ATPs out of it. So our yield is way better if we do most of our energy transfer in the form of those reduced cofactors. Then what do those cofactors actually do for us? They go to the electron transport chain. They drop off the electrons, the energy is passed from carrier to carrier, and that release of energy, little bits at a time, used to maneuver protons to the opposite side of the membrane, creating a gradient, which then powers our machine called the ATP synthase. That's kind of what we have talked about over the last two lectures in terms of carbohydrate metabolism. I want to ask a learning analytics question that sort of emphasizes certain points about this. I'm going to give you two statements. I want you to think about whether statement one is true or false and statement two is true or false. Here's statement one.  Zero molecules of ATP are directly synthesized by an electron transport chain. Statement two says zero molecules of hydrogen ions, zero protons, are pumped against a concentration gradient by ATP synthase. Are both of those true? Are they both false? Or one of each? What are your thoughts? Please feel free to talk with those around you. Thank you. One more minute, please. 30 seconds. 15 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, stop. This time I'm going to show you that there wasn't really a consensus in the room. So everybody, well not everybody, but a lot of different opinions on this. So you've got to think specifically about what's asked. You have to be able to separate one process from another. Let's talk about each of these statements individually. The first statement says it's asking how many ATPs are synthesized directly by the activity of an electron transport chain. It's called an electron transport chain. That's really all it does. I'm not saying we don't get work out of the transfer of those electrons, but the work from the handing off of the electrons is used to make the gradient. The only effort we get, and I don't mean to undermine the importance, but the only effort we get out of the electron transport chain, yes, we get our cofactors back in their oxidized state, but we also use the energy to pump protons and create the gradient. There is no ATP synthesized directly by an electron transport chain. The ultimate outcome of an electron transport chain is the generation of an electrochemical gradient. It's what you do with that electrochemical gradient that powers ATP synthesis, and it's the ATP synthase that makes the ATP, which leads to statement number two, which I could have phrased in a completely different way. I could have said, how many electrons are transferred in an ATP synthase? The answer would be none, right? An ATP synthase is not physically part of an electron transport chain. An electron transport chain begins with either complex one or two and ends with your terminal electron acceptor. And then, oh, by the way, over there is your ATP synthase machine. So they are physically separate structures. But this question was actually asking, how many protons am I going to force against a concentration gradient by an ATP synthase? Zero. Because the ATP synthase is how you allow the protons back through. The kinetic energy of the protons flowing is converted to the mechanical energy of turning a rotor, which is converted to the kinetic chemical energy of the bond being formed. So it turns out both of those statements are true. An electron transport chain doesn't make any ATP, and an ATP synthase doesn't pump any protons. Both of those statements are true. All right. Now, that was all an elaborate discussion about carbohydrate metabolism. But Brad, I'm on a low-carb diet. Does that mean I'm not making ATP? No, it doesn't mean that at all. It means your ATP comes from other sources. So how do you get ATP if you're on a low-carb diet of some kind? You do the things that are shown in this figure. I don't want anybody to try to memorize all the details on this figure. Let me explain to you what I'm hoping you get out of this figure. Notice the horizontal row, if you will, more or less in the middle. Glucose to pyruvate to acetyl-CoA to citric acid cycle. We've been there. This is not new territory. That's carbohydrate metabolism. The question is, if I'm on a low-carb diet, restricting my carbohydrates, do I still make ATP? Yes, you do. There's two... Two possible ways that you could do that. One, you could just feed other products into an already evolutionarily well-established pathway, or you could try to evolve a separate protein metabolism pathway and fatty acid metabolism pathway. Why reinvent the wheel? This big line that goes in the middle of the figure works awfully well and has worked for all living organisms for billions of years. Well, maybe not billions, but a long, long time. This pathway has been around. So we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Just take what you've got, do some conversions, and dump the resulting products into what we already have. So if you're on a high-protein diet, either intentionally or by accident, you just eat a lot of protein, you're going to take those proteins, you're going to break them down into individual amino acids. That's 20 different starting things. One thing that we're going to do with pretty much all of them, unless you want to reuse them as amino acids. Which is really the body's preferred thing to do with the amino acids that are released by breaking down. I mean, you didn't need a chicken breast because you needed chicken proteins. You ate a chicken breast because you needed amino acids to make your own proteins. So you're going to break the protein down into amino acids. You could use those amino acids to build your own proteins. But if you need the energy, the cell's going to forego making those new proteins, and it's going to strip the amino group. It's called deamination. You're going to strip the amino group off of those amino acids. And based on the side chain, what's left can be converted into molecules that are already part of... Like, you can... There are four different amino acids. It's pretty simple. Once you've deaminated them to turn them into pyruvate. You've bypassed glycolysis. There are amino acids that, once you strip the amino group off, a little bit of modification. They're now acetyl groups. You add a coenzyme A to it, now you've got acetyl-CoA. There are still others, lots of others, that can be turned into one of the molecules in the Krebs cycle. Just feed what you've got into what we already have. Again, don't reinvent the wheel. Same thing with fats. Fat metabolism. Talking about triglycerides. What do you do with triglycerides? Well, we know that triglycerides have long fatty acid tails on them, and we know that those hydrocarbon tails are just repeating units of H's and C's. Well, you add two fatty acids and break them off of fatty acids in two carbon units. That's why back when we talked about lipid structure, we talked about fatty acids having maybe C4, you know, 14 carbon tails or 16 or 22. There were never any 17s or 19s, right? When you make fatty acids, you put them together in two carbon units. When you break them down, you break them apart in two carbon units. Those two carbon units go by another name in chemistry. They're called acetyl groups. So you can take any two carbon unit, now it's an acetyl group, add a coenzyme A to it, boom, you're right in the middle of carbohydrate metabolism without having to have started with a carbohydrate. So the answer to how do I get ATP if I don't eat a bunch of carbs is you just take what you are eating and convert them into things that are already along the way. So you're not hurting yourself. Too much protein is not good for you, but mostly because the more you take and start turning into energy, the less you have for making your own proteins. Now I'm going to talk about something else, a little bit different. I'm going to switch gears just a little bit. If I'm doing aerobic respiration and I run out of oxygen, what happens? Some cells have to just make do with the two molecules of ATP that they're making per molecule of glucose that they did in glycolysis. Others have the ability to... Oh, and by the way, that's probably not going to last very long. So it's really important that those cells get their terminal electron acceptor back as quickly as possible. But some cells have the ability to take the pyruvate... and do something with it that you didn't really care about. I'm gonna show you a couple of figures in a second where most of the figure isn't actually important. Sort of like when I say, when we break down our glucose, we end up with a lot of carbon dioxide. So what? That's a byproduct, right? I'm drawing a parallel to that here. What we're gonna do with that pyruvate isn't as important as what we can do along the way with that pyruvate. We're not gonna get any more ATP out of it. This is a super important point about what I'm going to refer to as fermentation reactions. You don't get any more ATP out of the pyruvate because you're not doing Krebs cycle, you're not doing the rest of aerobic respiration, you're not doing oxidative phosphorylation. The only ATP you make is from glycolysis. But some cells have the ability to do fermentation reactions which serve one purpose and one purpose only. Get your NAD plus back. That's the only reason why cells do fermentation reactions. It's the only way that they have to get their NAD plus back. If you're built to do aerobic respiration, then if things are cooking along the way they're supposed to, you've got oxygen available to you, you're getting your NAD plus back every time an NADH drops off electrons at the electron transport chain. The job is being done for you. And, oh by the way, I'm building an electrochemical gradient which powers my ATP synthase and gives me 36 molecules of ATP per glucose instead of 2, which is what you get from glycolysis. But if you don't have your terminal electron acceptor, Krebs cycle shuts down, electron transport shuts down. The only ATP that you have is from glycolysis. There are no ATPs generated in a fermentation reaction. But... You can still do glycolysis because glycolysis is not physically tied to aerobic respiration the way Krebs cycle is. So you can still do glycolysis as long as you get your NAD plus back. You don't have that much NAD plus in a cell, you keep doing glycolysis and don't re-oxidize that NADH back into NAD plus, now glycolysis shuts down and no living organism can survive that. You have to be able to do glycolysis. Alright? So, it's super important to recognize that this is not found in every cell. Not every cell that lives in an aerobic environment has the ability to do fermentation. Some do, some don't. And I mentioned this earlier in the semester, even among organisms like humans, which have cell types that can do fermentation, it doesn't mean all of our cell types can do fermentation. Our muscle cells can do fermentation. That's why you get that burn when you're doing aerobic exercise. You've run out of oxygen. You're building up a byproduct called lactic acid. You didn't take pyruvate and turn it into lactic acid because you wanted lactic acid. It's a means to an end. So let's talk about those means in terms of which different cell types can do it. Oh, before I move on to the next slide, I want to make a point about this. If you're used to making, let's just say $36,000 a year, and all of a sudden you get your wages cut to $2,000 a year and that's it. If you want to continue to provide for yourself, you're going to have to do more work than what you were doing before. So you will never get any more ATP out of glycolysis than two ATPs per molecule of glucose. But there's another way that we can think about glycolysis. How many molecules of glucose are you using up per unit of time? So, if you've got oxygen available to you, you actually don't do glycolysis as fast as you can. You do it as fast as you need to, to be churning out an appropriate amount of pyruvate, which then, along with the reduced cofactors, then feeds aerobic respiration. You're not doing glycolysis as fast as you can all the time, or you constantly need to be eating. If you do fermentation, now you get your wages cut from 36 to 2, you're going to have to do more glycolysis. You will never make more per molecule of glucose than two ATPs, but if you do glycolysis 10 to 20 times faster than you were doing it before, then you will make more ATP per unit of time. So, I hope everybody sees the difference between... ...per molecule of glucose and per unit of time. Cells that are able to do fermentation reactions jack up the rate of glycolysis 10 to 20 times what they were doing before. Which, yes, means they're using up their food sources 20 times faster than they were. Anybody ever done any home brewing? I know you're not in that demographic. I've got a lot of friends who like to make their own beer. When you're doing home brewing, you will use yeast cells that are called brewer's yeast, you know, conveniently, and they take pyruvate and they turn it in a two-step process. Don't worry about the details involved here. They turn the pyruvate into ethanol. That's where the alcohol comes from. You're forcing yeast to live in an anaerobic environment. Brewers' yeast have the ability to do fermentation when they're not in the presence of oxygen, but they have to do glycolysis 20 times faster to stay alive, so you, the brewer, have to give them tons of sugar. You put a lot of sugar into your brewing process because you're feeding fermentation in these fermenting yeast. And a byproduct is ethanol. The yeast didn't make it to have a good time. The yeast made it to get their NAD plus back. So in everything in that figure, what's the only really important part in that figure? The part in color. The rest of it isn't really all that important. Yes, I'm going to take pyruvate. Yes, I'm going to turn it into ethanol. This is what's important. I'm going to take my NADH and I'm going to oxidize it into NAD plus, and I'm going to have some protons left over. So that's what's important. This allows the yeast to continue to do glycolysis. Other organisms have different fermentation reactions. An example from a lot of the bacterial world, the aerobic bacterial world and in human muscle cells, we don't turn it into ethanol. That would be incentive to exercise, wouldn't it? If you built up ethanol in your cells when you were exercising, maybe we'd all be a little more fit. I'm just saying. But we don't make ethanol, we make lactic acid, which instead of making you feel really good, makes your muscles burn. Then that lactic acid is taken out of your muscle cells, it's transferred into the bloodstream, goes into the liver and gets turned into glycogen. So we get a bonus from it. But no ATP, there's no substrate level phosphorylation reactions on this figure. The cells didn't make the lactic acid because they wanted lactic acid. They wanted an excuse to turn NADH back into NAD+. So again, fermentation reactions don't get you any more energy, but they do give you your oxidized form of your cofactor back. And it allows glycolysis to continue, hopefully, until you get your oxygen back. You know, that's why you don't exercise forever. You gotta stop at some point and take a few deep breaths. Get the oxygen back to your muscles. So that's fermentation. Let's talk about how all of this stuff is regulated. Because cells don't want to be wasting their time, effort, and real estate. If I don't need to do it right now, I shouldn't be doing it right now. Molecules take up space, real estate is very valuable inside a cell, and I can't have things around doing work that is taking resources away from something else that I need more. So regulation, I'll give you a more textbook definition of regulation later in the semester, but my colloquial definition of regulation is always when you don't need it, turn it off. When you do need it, turn it on. That's regulation in a nutshell. So don't use any more energy than necessary, and how are we going to coordinate this? Two primary ways. And we'll talk a lot more about more detailed forms of regulation later in the semester. But to get us started, there's kind of two global ways that we could regulate something as broad strokes as metabolism. I could limit the amount of enzyme I have at all, or I could limit the activity of existing molecules of those enzymes. Allosterically regulated enzymes. Remember the word allosteric? It means a site other than the active site. So I'm going to give you a description that is going to sound, I hope, somewhat familiar. But it's not identical to the scenario where it came up the first time. I want to talk about enzymes having binding sites on them that regulatory molecules can bind to. If it's somewhere, anywhere, other than the active site, it's called an allosteric site. And when the allosteric regulator binds to the allosteric site, it changes the shape, the conformation of the active site, and it limits... No, I don't want to say that. It changes the ability of that enzyme to do its job. The reason why I corrected myself. If we use the word limit, we're putting a limit on the conversation and saying that allosteric regulators can only decrease the activity of an enzyme. But that's not true. Notice that everything in that first sentence at the top of the slide is intentionally vague. About whether it makes the enzyme worse or better in the moment at doing its job. You bind something at a site other than the active site to which regulatory molecules bind, you change the confirmation of the active site. None of that defines whether I turn the activity up or down. And the reason is, it could go either way. Allosteric regulator molecules can either increase the activity of the enzyme or decrease it. Now, reflect back a few weeks when we were talking about enzyme inhibition. Maybe just a few days, right? We talked about an inhibitor molecule binding to an allosteric site and turning the enzyme off or down, at least temporarily, because it's reversible. There's a lot of similarity between negative allosteric regulation and non-competitive enzyme inhibition. But a biochemist would attempt to mathematically prove to you that they are not the same. I'm not going to ask you to do any kind of that math. I think they sound an awful lot alike. So the real point that I want to make is, yes, you can negatively regulate, which is very similar to non-competitive inhibition, but depending on the nature of the regulatory molecule, you have the potential of turning up the activity of that enzyme. Just like I said glycolysis isn't usually going as fast as it can, enzymes usually aren't going as fast as they can. Because maybe I don't need that much product right now. What I want is to be able to turn a dial instead of flip a switch. If it's on or off, that doesn't give me any gray area. I don't want to make zero product molecules per unit of time, or a thousand. I want to, maybe I need 500, maybe I need 20. I want to be able to turn the dial. And having this type of positive and negative regulation allows me more of a dial metaphor than a switch metaphor. So this probably is self-explanatory. If the regulatory molecule binds to an allosteric site and increases the activity of the enzyme, we're going to call it a positive regulator. If a different molecule binds to that same or different allosteric site and decreases the activity of that same enzyme, it's called a negative regulator. And like I just said,
