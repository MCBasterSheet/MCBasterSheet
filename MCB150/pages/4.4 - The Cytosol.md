# The Cytosol is the region of a eukaryotic cell outside organelles inside plasma membrane
	- This includes cytosol and the organelles still (Just remember the second part)
- # Synthesis and Breakdown of Molecules Occur in the Cytosol
	- ## Metabolism is the sum of chemical reactions for cells to produce materials and use energy to sustain life
		- Although many steps of metabolism also occur in cell organelles, the cytosol is a central coordinating region for many metabolic activities in eukaryotic cells
		- Metabolism often involves a series of steps called a metabolic pathway
			- Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme
		- Some metabolic pathways involve breakdown of a molecule into smaller components, something called **Catabolism**
			- This is to utilize energy and generate molecules that provide building blocks to construct macromolecules
		- Another one is called the pathway for **anabolism** the synthesis of molecules and macromolecules
			- E.g. polysaccharides are made by linking sugar molecules
			- To make proteins, amino acids are connects to make a polypeptide
			- Translation occurs on ribosomes
- # The Cytoskeleton Provides Cell Shape, Organization, and Movement
	- ## It is a network of Microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin Filaments
		- Each type is constructed from many protein monomers
		- The cytoskeleton is an example of protein-protein interactions
		- The cytoskeleton is found primarily in the cytosol and in the nucleus along the inner nuclear membrane
	- ## Now let us consider the structure of the cytoskeletal filaments & their roles in construction and organization of cells
		- ### Microtubules
			- They are long, hollow, cylindrical structures 25 nanometers in diameter and composed of protein subunits called alpha and beta tubulin
			- The assembly of tubulin to form a microtubule results in a structure with a plus and minus end
				- Microtubules only grow in the plus end but can shorten at either end
				- A single microtubule can oscillate between growing and shortening  termed **dynamic instability**
				- Important in many cellular activities, including sorting chromosomes during cell division
			- The sites where they form in a cell varies among organisms
			- A **microtubule organizing center (MTOC)** is a site in a eukaryotic cell which microtubules grow from
			- Non-dividing animal cells have  a single MTOC near their nucleus called the **centrosome**
				- Within the centrosome are centrioles, a pair of structures arranged perpendicularly to each other
				- In animals, microtubule growth starts at the centrosome in such a way that the minus end is anchored there
				- Plants on the other hand lack centrosomes and centrioles
					- Sites along nuclear membrane appear to be the MTOCs
					- Microtubules are important for cell shape and organization
						- Things like the Golgi apparatus are attached to the microtubules
						- Additionally, microtubules are involved in organization and movement of chromosomes during mitosis and in the orientation of cells during cell division
		- ### Intermediate Filaments
			- They are another class of cytoskeletal filaments found in the cells of many but not all animal species
			- Name comes from observation that they are intermediate in diameter between actin filaments and microtubules
			- They bind to each other in a staggered array to form a twisted ropelike structure with a diameter of approximately 10 nanometers
				- They function as tension-bearing fibers that help maintain cell shape and rigidity
				- Their lengths are relatively permanent
					- By comparison, microtubules and actin filaments readily lengthen and shorten in cells
			- Several types of proteins assemble into intermediate filaments.
				- Keratins form intermediate filaments in skin, intestinal, and kidney cells, important for cell shape and mechanical strength
				- Keratinocytes are cells that synthesize large amounts of keratin
					- They are major constituents of hair, nails, and the surface of your skin
				- Intermediate filaments are also found inside the cell nucleus
				- Cell lamins form a network o intermediate filaments that line the inner nuclear membrane and give anchors for nuclear pores
			- **Actin Filaments** are known as microfilaments as they have the thinnest cytoskeletal filaments
				- They are long and thin (7nm in diameter)
				- They have plus and minus ends
					- Plus ends grow towards plasma membrane and play a key role in cell shape and movement
				- They have dynamic structures where the strand grows at the plus end by adding actin monomers
				- This process makes a fiber of two strands of actin monomers that spiral around each other
				- Despite their thinness, they play a key role in cell shape and strength
					- Although they are dispersed along the cytosol, they tend to be highly concentrated near the plasma membrane
					- Actin filaments support the plasma membrane, providing shape and strength to the cell
					- The sides of actin filaments are anchored to other proteins near the plasma membrane (which is why they are often found there)

- # Motor Proteins Interact with Cytoskeletal Filaments to Promote Movement
	- ## **Motor Proteins** are a category of proteins using ATP as energy to promote types of movement
		- A motor proteins consists of a head, hinge, and tail.
			- The hinge and tail make up a structure called the lever arm
			- The head is the site where ATP binds and is hydrolyzed to Adenosine Triphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P_{i})
			- ATP binding and hydrolysis creates a bend in the hinge resulting in movement.
			- The tail region is attached to other proteins or to other kinds of cellular molecules
		- To cause movement, the head interacts with a cytoskeletal filament like the actin filament
			- When ATP binds and is hydrolyzed the motor protein interacts with the filament in these steps:
				- The head is initially attached
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- The head detaches, 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Then it cocks forward, 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Lastly it binds to another point farther along on the filament and cocks backwards
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- This is like walking and the ground is a cytoskeletal filament. Your leg is the head, your hip is the hinge
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- To walk, you lift your leg up, then you move it forward, put it back on the ground, then cock it backward (propels your forward)
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Just like how a motor protein moves along the cytoskeletal filament
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- They cause three kinds of movement:
			- Movement of cargo via motor protein
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Movement of the filament
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Bending of the filament
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- E.g.
			- The tail region of a motor protein called kinesin is attached to a cargo, then it moves the cargo from one place to another
			- Another one called myosin can remain in place and cause the filament to move. This is muscle contraction
			- Lastly, we have both the motor protein and filament being restricted in their movement due to linking proteins. In this case, when motor proteins called dynein attempt to walk toward the minus end, they exert a force that causes the microtubules to bend

- # Cilia and Flagella Allow Cells to Move
	- ## MIcrotubules and motor proteins facilitate movement involving cell appendages called flagella and cilia
		- Flagella are longer than cilia and usually found singularly or in pairs.
	- ## Both flagella and cilia cause movement by generating bends that move along their length and push backward against the surrounding fluid.
		- The flagellum of a sperm cell generates bends alternatively in each direction, which begin at the head and move (**propagate**) towards the tip of the flagellum
		- Another way is that a pair of flagella may move in a synchronized manner to pull a microorganism through the water (like breaststroke)
			- Certain unicellular algae move like this
		- Cilia typically are shorter and cover the whole cell. Protists like paramecia may have hundreds of adjacent cilia that beat in a coordinated fashion to propel the organism through the water
	- ## Flagella and Cilia have the same internal Structure, called the Axoneme
		- The Axoneme contains microtubules, the motor protein dyenein, and linking proteins
		- In cilia and flagella of most eukaryotes, the microtubules form an arrangement called a 9+2 array
			- The outer 9 are doublet microtubules, and have a partial microtubules attached to a complete microtubule
			- Each of the two central microtubules is a single microtubule
			- Radial Spokes project from the outer doublet microtubules towards the central pair
		- The microtubules in flagella and cilia emanate from **basal bodies** which are anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.
			- The basal body has microtubules forming a triplet structure
			- Like the centrosome of animal cells, the basal bodies provide a site for microtubules to grow
		- The movement involves the propagation of a bend.
			- It begins at the base and proceeds toward the tip.
			- The bending occurs because dynein activates to walk towards the minus end of teh tubule
			- These are not free however, as linking proteins keep them still.
			- Instead of freely walking along the microtubule, the dyneins exert a force that bends the microtubule
			- The dyneins at the base are activated first, followed by ones progressively closer to the tip, propelling the organism
