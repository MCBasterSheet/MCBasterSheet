> DNA carries the genetic instructions for the traits of Living Organisms
> Multicellular organisms, like us, have the genetic material to let a fertilized egg to develop an embryo and soon into an adult
> Genetic Material Also allows organisms to survive in their native environments, giving them the blueprint for enzymes to metabolize nutrients in food
>
> To Fulfill its roles, genetic Material must meet the following criteria:
> 1. **Information**: The genetic material must contain the info needed to construct an entire organisms
> 2. **Replication**: The genetic material must be accurately copied, aka DNA Replication
> 3. **Transmission**: After replication, the genetic material can be passed from parents to offspring, then to cell to cell during cell division
> 4. **Variation**: Differences in genetic material must be accounted for the known variations within each species and among different species

> How was this stuff discovered? Late 19th century, scientists though we had a blueprint. 1883, August Weismann and Karl Nageli thought chemical substances exist within living cells responsible for transmission of traits from parents to offspring
> For 30 years, they experimented on Chromosomes (Chromo, soma due to how it was observed via colored dyes and being stained).
> They just studied transmission patterns of chromosomes from cell to cell and from parents to offspring and how it controlled the outcome of traits
>
> THIS WAS MISLEADING, as chromosomes had DNA and proteins, so they thought proteins were the real blueprint, but they found it was actually the DNA in the end
> Lol they thought it was just the 20 amino acid thing not the 4 nucleotide thing

# Griffith's Bacterial Transformation Experiments Indicated the Existence of a Genetic Material
- 1920s, Griffith studied bacterium known as pneumococci, and now Streptococcus pneumoniae have a polysaccharide capsules, whilst other strains dont
  - Secreteless ones are rough, secreting ones are smooth. Smooth strains cause pneumonia
- He then decided to test it by injecting live or heat killed bacteria into mice then seeing whether the mice die
  - He did this with Type S and type R for two strains of S. pneumoniae (Smooth and Rough Respectively)
- Procedure:
    1. In a live mouse, Type S killed it. The Capsule made by Type S strains prevents the mouse's immune system from killing bacterial cells. After death, the type S bacteria was found in the mouse's blood
    2. When type R bacteria was injected, the mouse lived, and several days later, living bacteria was not in the mouse's blood
    3. Griffith also heat-killed the type S bacteria and injected it into the mouse. The mouse lived
    4. Now live type R and heat-killed type S was injected. Now the mouse died. The mouse had type S bacteria. Griffith thought that the substance from dead type S bacteria transformed the type R bacteria into type S bacteria.
       a. This is called transformation, and he said the unknown material responsible for the phenomenon is the transformation principle

- Connecting this to the four criteria of genetic material:
  - Information
  - Replication
  - Transmission
  - Variation
- The transformed bacteria acquired the information to make the capsule from heat-killed cells (I)
- The transformed bacteria to proliferate and kill the mouse required the ability to be replicated (II) and transmitted (III) from mother to daughter cells during bacterial cell division
- Griffith already knew Variation (IV) existed in the ability of his strains to either produce a capsule (S strain) or not produce a capsule (R strain)
- Then he was like, yeah, this is genetic variation!
- Step four indicated some genetic material from the heat killed type S bacterial has been transferred to the living type R bacteria and prodvided those bacteria with a new Trait
