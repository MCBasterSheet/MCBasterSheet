# Lecture Summary

## Introduction

> Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to exam week in MCB 150. Our first exam is on Thursday, and Melissa Reedy has detailed all the highlights of this week in announcements. Make sure to check Canvas regularly for updates. Today's lecture marks the end of exam one material.

## Revisiting Activation Energy

> We left off discussing the energy of activation, the barrier needed for reactions, even spontaneous ones, to occur. Enzymes play a crucial role in reducing this barrier, making reactions energetically favorable. Enzymes speed up existing reactions, demonstrating their impact on energy levels during biological reactions.

## Enzyme Function and Take-home Points

> Enzymes facilitate reactions that could happen naturally, reducing barriers for biologically relevant rates. They don't change the delta G but significantly lower the energy of activation. The energy activation diagram illustrates the enzyme's role in reducing the activation hump, enabling reactions to proceed at a faster rate.

## Enzyme-Substrate Interaction and Induced Fit

> Enzymes bind substrates in active sites, creating an induced fit where the enzyme's shape changes to accommodate the substrate. This ensures the right orientation and conditions for the reaction, emphasizing the importance of the three-dimensional active site structure.

## Temperature and pH Optimums

> Enzyme activity is influenced by temperature and pH. Optimum conditions, often around human body temperature and cytosolic pH, enhance enzyme efficiency. Temperature and pH optima vary, reflecting the environmental conditions where specific enzymes operate optimally.

## Irreversible Inhibition and Examples

> Irreversible inhibitors permanently inactivate enzymes. Examples like sarin gas demonstrate their lethality by irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, crucial for nerve impulse transmission. While irreversible inhibition can be lethal, not all irreversible inhibitors are, with aspirin as an example.

## Reversible Inhibition and Categories

> Reversible inhibitors offer temporary inhibition and can be either competitive or noncompetitive. Competitive inhibitors compete with substrates for active sites, while noncompetitive inhibitors bind elsewhere, altering the enzyme's shape. Reversible inhibition allows for enzyme regulation and recyclability.

## Regulation and Efficiency

> Cells often regulate enzymes by turning them off temporarily, optimizing efficiency. This ensures resources aren't wasted on unnecessary enzymes, emphasizing the importance of regulation in cellular processes.

## Examples of Reversible Inhibition

> Aspirin, an irreversible inhibitor, temporarily inhibits cyclooxygenase, providing relief from symptoms. Reversible inhibitors, although not lethal, highlight the need for enzyme recycling for sustained functionality. Thus, we must get into reversible inhibition.

## Competitive Inhibition

> Competitive inhibition involves a physical competition between the natural substrate and an inhibitor molecule. The inhibitor resembles the substrate in the region binding to the active site. The balance between substrate and inhibitor concentrations determines the rate of product formation. Flooding out the inhibitor with excess substrate is a reversible way to overcome competitive inhibition.

## Overcoming Competitive Inhibition

> While flooding out with excess substrate is a lab technique, it's not always feasible in cellular contexts like nutrient availability. Alternatively, the cell can decrease the production of the inhibitor, effectively inhibiting the inhibitor itself and restoring enzyme activity.

## Example of Competitive Inhibition

> An example is DHPS enzyme in bacteria, essential for nucleotide synthesis. Sulfa drugs like sulfanilamide competitively inhibit DHPS by resembling the substrate. This competition disrupts the bacterial process, making it a potent antibiotic.

## Non-Competitive Inhibition

> Non-competitive inhibition involves an inhibitor binding to an allosteric site, distinct from the active site. It doesn't involve a competition with the substrate. The inhibition is reversible, but flooding out the inhibitor with excess substrate doesn't restore enzyme activity.

## Overcoming Non-Competitive Inhibition

> Overcoming non-competitive inhibition involves removing the inhibitor itself, as increasing substrate concentration doesn't affect the inhibition. Cells have control over these inhibitors, making the process reversible.

## Biochemistry of Enzyme Action

> Vmax represents the maximum velocity of enzyme action, indicating the maximum rate of product formation with abundant substrate. Km, the substrate concentration at half Vmax, reflects the enzyme's affinity for its substrate. Affinity is inversely proportional to Km, and enzymes vary in their Km values.

## Effect of Inhibitors on Km and Vmax

### Competitive Inhibitors

> - **Vmax:** Unchanged
> - **Km:** Increases due to the competition with the inhibitor

### Non-Competitive Inhibitors

> - **Vmax:** Decreases as the inhibitor prevents enzymes from reaching their full potential
> - **Km:** Unchanged, as the inhibition is not affected by substrate concentration

## Conclusion

> Understanding competitive and non-competitive inhibition, along with the biochemistry of enzyme action, is essential for comprehending cellular regulation. Good luck to everyone in the upcoming exam!
