# Lecture Summary

## Introduction

> Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to exam week in MCB 150. Our first exam is on Thursday, and Melissa Reedy has detailed all the highlights of this week in announcements. Make sure to check Canvas regularly for updates. Today's lecture marks the end of exam one material.

## Revisiting Activation Energy

> We left off discussing the energy of activation, the barrier needed for reactions, even spontaneous ones, to occur. Enzymes play a crucial role in reducing this barrier, making reactions energetically favorable. Enzymes speed up existing reactions, demonstrating their impact on energy levels during biological reactions.

## Enzyme Function and Take-home Points

> Enzymes facilitate reactions that could happen naturally, reducing barriers for biologically relevant rates. They don't change the delta G but significantly lower the energy of activation. The energy activation diagram illustrates the enzyme's role in reducing the activation hump, enabling reactions to proceed at a faster rate.

## Enzyme-Substrate Interaction and Induced Fit

> Enzymes bind substrates in active sites, creating an induced fit where the enzyme's shape changes to accommodate the substrate. This ensures the right orientation and conditions for the reaction, emphasizing the importance of the three-dimensional active site structure.

## Temperature and pH Optimums

> Enzyme activity is influenced by temperature and pH. Optimum conditions, often around human body temperature and cytosolic pH, enhance enzyme efficiency. Temperature and pH optima vary, reflecting the environmental conditions where specific enzymes operate optimally.

## Irreversible Inhibition and Examples

> Irreversible inhibitors permanently inactivate enzymes. Examples like sarin gas demonstrate their lethality by irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, crucial for nerve impulse transmission. While irreversible inhibition can be lethal, not all irreversible inhibitors are, with aspirin as an example.

## Reversible Inhibition and Categories

> Reversible inhibitors offer temporary inhibition and can be either competitive or noncompetitive. Competitive inhibitors compete with substrates for active sites, while noncompetitive inhibitors bind elsewhere, altering the enzyme's shape. Reversible inhibition allows for enzyme regulation and recyclability.

## Regulation and Efficiency

> Cells often regulate enzymes by turning them off temporarily, optimizing efficiency. This ensures resources aren't wasted on unnecessary enzymes, emphasizing the importance of regulation in cellular processes.

## Examples of Reversible Inhibition

> Aspirin, an irreversible inhibitor, temporarily inhibits cyclooxygenase, providing relief from symptoms. Reversible inhibitors, although not lethal, highlight the need for enzyme recycling for sustained functionality.
