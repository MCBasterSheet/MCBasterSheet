## Exorcism and RNA Mechanics

Over the weekend, I witnessed a real exorcism involving my cousin. Terrifyingly, after the ordeal, the priest asked for payment. Lacking cash, my poor cousin got "repossessed."

## Welcome to MCB150: Monday Madness

Good afternoon! Happy Monday, everyone. Today in MCB150, we dive back into the intricate world of transcription mechanics. We'll explore promoter orientation, the fascinating dance between template and complementary strands, and unravel the mysteries of transcription termination. Hold on tight; it's going to be a wild ride.

## Promoter Orientation and Hotspots

The critical aspect of transcription is understanding promoter orientation. Picture this: a section of DNA with three genes (A, B, and C), each with its own promoter. Gene A's promoter dictates the polymerase's movement from left to right, using the bottom strand as a template. Meanwhile, gene B follows suit, using the same template as gene A. However, gene C plays the rebel; its promoter guides the polymerase in the opposite direction, using the top strand as a template. No two genes have to conform - it's a DNA rebellion!

## The Unyielding Gene and the Directional Drama

A gene is stubborn; it doesn't like to switch things up. If it chooses to use the bottom strand as a template, it's committed. No flip-flopping allowed. Imagine the chaos if a gene could decide, "Today, I'll use the top strand." Nope, directionality is the name of the game. Move appropriately or be terminated.

## Termination Tango: E. coli Style

Elongation is the dance of transcription, but every dance has its end. In E. coli, termination comes in two flavors: with or without help. The helper, Rho protein, ensures termination efficiency by climbing the RNA rope and peeling it away from DNA. If a gene needs no assistance, intrinsic termination steals the spotlight. The RNA forms a stem-loop structure, giving the polymerase a tug, and a run of adenines seals the deal, leaving the polymerase bewildered and terminated.

## A Symphony of RNA: Types and Functions

RNA, the unsung hero of cellular activities. Classic RNA types - messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - rule the cell's orchestra. Don't be fooled by the simplicity; the transcript diversity is expanding rapidly. Remember, RNA doesn't care about its destiny; it's the cell's job to decipher its purpose.

## Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases: Three's a Crowd

Eukaryotes have three RNA polymerases, each with its exclusive role. RNA polymerase I exclusively crafts ribosomal RNA, RNA polymerase II is the maestro of messenger RNA, and RNA polymerase III handles the small but mighty transfer RNA. Promoters are the gatekeepers, ensuring each polymerase finds its intended genes.

## Promoter Chronicles: Similar Yet Unique

Promoters, the navigators of transcription, share similarities but remain unique. The footprints, the conserved regions, dance differently for each polymerase. Promoters are the GPS guiding the polymerase to its destination, ensuring precision in gene transcription.

## Pol III Promoter: Breaking the Mold

Amidst the conventional upstream promoters, Pol III breaks the mold. Its promoter resides within the coding region, downstream of the plus one base. A quirky exception to the rule, Pol III brings an intriguing twist to the transcription saga.
