**The plasma Membrane is important**
  - It encloses the Cytoplasm
  - Eukaryotic cells have internal membranes surrounding organelles
  - Separates internals to external environment
  - Super thin, but they are dynamic in structure and maintain separation of cell and surroundings and provides interfaces for vital cellular activities
This chapter covers the components making structure and fluidity of membranes and then how they are synthesized. We will also see membrane transport
  - Big part of membranes is how it regulates traffic of substances into and out of the cell and its organelles
  - This occurs via transport proteins and via exocytosis and endocytosis (read ahead to learn more)
