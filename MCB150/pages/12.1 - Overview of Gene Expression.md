>   - Mutations may affect genetic material by altering gene function
>   - And so researching the effects of mutations were vital in finding the molecular functions of genes

# The Study of Inborn Errors on Metabolism Suggested That Some Genes Carry the Information to Make Enzymes
- 1908 Archibald Garrod, a Brit, proposed relationship between genes and the production of enzymes.
  - Before this, biochemists studied metabolic pathways that were a series of conversions of one molecule to another, catalyzed by enzymes
- The image below shows the metabolic pathway in breaking down Phenylalanine, an amino acid in human diets
  - Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the conversino of phenyalanine to tyrosine (another Amino Acid)
  - Then Tyrosine aminotransferase converts it into the next molecule, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid
  - Each step has a specific enzyme catalyzing a single reaction
- This fool, Garrod, worked on the alkaptonuria disease where the body just retains homogentisic acid (alkapton)
  - This makes skin and cartilage and one's piss to turn black
    - [Image of Condition (CAUTION, GRAPHIC)](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/assets/Alkaptonuria.avif)
  - Garrod thought that this is due to a defective homogentistic acid oxidase enzyme
  - And with alkaptonuria being inherited recessively (need both alleles to express), he thought that inheriting the mutant gene led to a defect in metabolism
  - So in the ase of alkaptonuria, inheriting the gene from both parents leads to a lack of normal homogentisic acid metabolizing enzymes.
  - Thus Alkaptonuria is an **inborn error of metabolism**, a gene inherited by one or both parents
    - Despite him being British, this was quite insightful as the structure and function of genetic material were completely unknown at that time.

# Beadle and Tatum Proposed the One-Gene/One-Enzyme Hypothesis
- George Beadle and Edward Tatum saw Garrod's work and decided to work on Neurospora crassa, bread mold.
  - Easy to grow, few nutritional requirements, inorganic salts, and biotin.
  - Also need amino acids and vitamins
- All three proposed genes have the information to make enzymes
- They say mutation in gene can mess with the actual enzymes
- They also knew about the way Arginine is produced during that time, so it became easier to actually figure out how the enzymes work as they knew about precursor molecules
