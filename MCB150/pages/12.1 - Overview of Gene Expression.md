# The Study of Inborn Errors on Metabolism Suggested That Some Genes Carry the Information to Make Enzymes
- 1908 Archibald Garrod, a Brit, proposed relationship between genes and the production of enzymes.
  - Before this, biochemists studied metabolic pathways that were a series of conversions of one molecule to another, catalyzed by enzymes
- The image below shows the metabolic pathway in breaking down Phenylalanine, an amino acid in human diets
  - Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the conversino of phenyalanine to tyrosine (another Amino Acid)
  - Then Tyrosine aminotransferase converts it into the next molecule, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid
  - Each step has a specific enzyme catalyzing a single reaction
- This fool, Garrod, worked on the alkaptonuria disease where the body just retains homogentisic acid (alkapton)
  - This makes skin and cartilage and one's piss to turn black
    - [Image of Condition (CAUTION, GRAPHIC)](https://github.com/MCBasterSheet/MCBasterSheet/blob/main/MCB150/assets/Alkaptonuria.avif)
  - Garrod thought that this is due to a defective homogentistic acid oxidase enzyme
  - And with alkaptonuria being inherited recessively (need both alleles to express), he thought that inheriting the mutant gene led to a defect in metabolism
  - So in the ase of alkaptonuria, inheriting the gene from both parents leads to a lack of normal homogentisic acid metabolizing enzymes.
  - Thus Alkaptonuria is an **inborn error of metabolism**, a gene inherited by one or both parents
    - Despite him being British, this was quite insightful as the structure and function of genetic material were completely unknown at that time.

# Beadle and Tatum Proposed the One-Gene/One-Enzyme Hypothesis
- George Beadle and Edward Tatum saw Garrod's work and decided to work on Neurospora crassa, bread mold.
  - Easy to grow, few nutritional requirements, inorganic salts, and biotin.
  - Also need amino acids and vitamins
- All three proposed genes have the information to make enzymes
- They say mutation in gene can mess with the actual enzymes
- They also knew about the way Arginine is produced during that time, so it became easier to actually figure out how the enzymes work as they knew about precursor molecules

- THEY GAVE THE BREAD MOLD CANCER WITH X-RAYS
- Then they found specific bread moles with cancer that is unable to grow outside of arginine and they found some mutants just missing enzymes to grow
  1. Group 1 having no enzyme 1 for ornithine, needing ornithine/citrulline/arginine to grow
  2. Group 2 have no enzyme 2 that makes ornithine to citrulline, needing citrulline or arginine
  3. Group 3 have no enzyme 3 that makes arginine from citrulline, needing arginine to grow

- This is the **one-gene/one-enzyme hypothesis** and then they won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine
- Now modified in 4 ways
   1. Information to make proteins all in genes, but many proteins do not function as enzymes
   2. Some proteins are made of 2+ polypeptides, and polypeptide is just the linear sequence of amino acids, the structure. Most genes carry the informaiton to make a particular polypeptide. Proteins are function and some proteins are one polypeptides. A single gene can make a single protein, like hemoglobin, where the protein that carries the oxygen in the red blood cells has two alpha-globin and two beta-globin polypeptides. Hemoglobin needs both genes to be expressed to make a functional protein
   3. Some mRNAs are spliced in alternative ways so they produce two+ polypeptides. This lets a single gene to made more than one polypeptide
   4. Some genes produe non-coding RNA not specifying amino acid sequences of a polypeptides

# Molecular Gene Expression Involves the Processes of Transcription and Translation
- Transcription is making RNA copy of a gene, RNA transcript. Act of making a copy. Most genes are protein-coding genes, making an RNA molecule containing the information to specify a polypeptides with a particular amino acid sequence
  - THIS IS MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) as it carries information from the DNA to ribosomes, synthesizing polypeptides via Translation as the bases in the mRNA is translated into amino acids 
- The transcription of DNA into mRNA and the translation of mRNA into a polypeptide makes the central dogma of gene expression at the molecular level (Francis Crick in 1958), applying to bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes
- Eukaryotes also have RNA modification, where the pre-mRNA (RNA transcript) and modified the ways to make a functionally active mRNA
- Bacteria do this in the cytoplasm, both transcription and translation
- Eukaryotes does it in the nucleus, and the mRNA exits the nucleus through a nuclear pore with translation in the cytosol

# The Protein Products of Genes Largely Determine an Organism's Characteristics
- The genes making genetic material make the blueprint for every characteristic of every organism
- Contain the information to produce an organisms to let it interact appropriately with the environment.
- Each protein-coded gene stores the information for the production of a polypeptide, becoming a unit of a functional protein
  - Proteins determine the structure and function of cells
  - Characteristics of organisms are rooted in the activities of cellular proteins
- Gene regulation facilitates the production of proteins in the correct cell at the proper time and in suitable amounts
  - Intricate as living cells make thousands of different proteins
  - Genetic analysis shows bacterium can make thousands of different proteins, and eukaryotes can make several thousands to tens of thousands proteins
