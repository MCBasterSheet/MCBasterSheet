> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Analyze the results of the experiments of Garrod and of Beadle and Tatum
> 2. Outline the general steps of gene expression at the molecular level, constituting the central dogma
> 3. Explain how proteins are largely responsible for determining an organisms's characteristics
>
> ## Long before the DNA was labled genetic material, Scientists asked "Man, how in the fuck does genes make organismal traist?"
> - And at the molecular level, they asked "And how in the fuck did genes affect the composition and slash or function of molecules found within living cells?
> - And so they studied mutations, changes in genetic material passed down from parent to offspring to find out
>   - Mutations may affect genetic material by altering gene function
>   - And so researching the effects of mutations were vital in finding the molecular functions of genes
> - This section will see how two early experiments studied mutations in humans and bread mold
> - And these studies all found genes as information carriers to produce enzymes, a type of protein.
>   - Then we examine the general features of gene expression at the molecular level
