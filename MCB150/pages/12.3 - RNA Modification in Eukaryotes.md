> # Learning Goals:
> 1. Describe the Addition of the 5` Cap and the 3prime poly A tail to eukaryotic mRNA
> 2. Explain the process of splicing that produces mature eukaryotic mRNA
>
> - Eukaryotic mRNA transcripts undergo modifications to produce functional mRNAs
> - Transcription of protein coding genes initially produces a longer RNA, called **pre-mRNA**
> - Here, we focus on how pre-mRNA is modified before it leaves the nucleus, creating **mature RNA**, or mRNA
>
> - Shown below, three different RNA modficiations are common
>   - 2 of them, capping and tailing, are modifications to the ends of the pre-mRNA
>     - These add a 5` cap and a polyA tail
>   - The third on is splicing, which removes internal segments called introns, while the exons are maintained in the mature mRNA
> - After all of these are completed, mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytosol to be translated
> - This section considers the molecular mechnisms responsible for the RNA modifications and we consider why they are functionally important

# The Ends of Eukaryotic Pre-mRNAs are modified by the Addition of a 5` Cap and a 3 Prime Poly A Tail
