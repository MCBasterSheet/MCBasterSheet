> 1. Describe the Addition of the 5` Cap and the 3prime poly A tail to eukaryotic mRNA
> 2. Explain the process of splicing that produces mature eukaryotic mRNA
>
> - Eukaryotic mRNA transcripts undergo modifications to produce functional mRNAs
> - Transcription of protein coding genes initially produces a longer RNA, called **pre-mRNA**
> - Here, we focus on how pre-mRNA is modified before it leaves the nucleus, creating **mature RNA**, or mRNA
>
> - Shown below, three different RNA modficiations are common
>   - 2 of them, capping and tailing, are modifications to the ends of the pre-mRNA
>     - These add a 5` cap and a polyA tail
>   - The third on is splicing, which removes internal segments called introns, while the exons are maintained in the mature mRNA
> - After all of these are completed, mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytosol to be translated
> - This section considers the molecular mechnisms responsible for the RNA modifications and we consider why they are functionally important

# The Ends of Eukaryotic Pre-mRNAs are modified by the Addition of a 5` Cap and a 3 Prime Poly A Tail
- Mature mRNAs of eukaryotes have a modified form of guanine covalently attached to the 5` end, this is capping
- Capping happens when pre-mRNA is still being made by RNA polymerase, when the transcript is only 20-25 bp in length
- WHY?
  - The 7-methylguanosine structure, the 5` cap, is recognized by cap-binding proteins, neede for the proper exit of mRNAs from the nucleus
  - After an mRNA is in the cytosol, the cap structure helps prevent its degredation
  - The cap structure is recognized by cap-binding proteins enabling mRNA to bind to a ribosome in translation

- At the 3` end, most mature eukaryotic mRNAs have a string of adenine nucleotides, 100-200 nucleotides in length known as a ** Poly A Tail**
- The **poly A tail** is not encoded in the gene sequence, instead it is enzymatically added after a pre-mRNA has been completely transcribed
  - A long poly A tail aids in the export of mRNA from the nucleus
  - It stabilizes a eukaryotic mRNA so it can exist for a longer period of time in the cytosol
- New Research has found some bacterial mRNAs with poly A tails in them
- However the poly A tail causes the mRNA to be rapidly degraded

# Splicing Involves the Removal of Introns and the Linkage of Exons
- In the 70s, when experimental tools to study eukaryotic genes at the molecular level came out, the scientific community was suprised by the discovery of coding sequences within many eukaryotic protein-coding genes are separated by DNA sequences transcribed by not translate dinto a protein.
